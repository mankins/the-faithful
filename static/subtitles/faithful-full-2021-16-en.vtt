WEBVTT

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.527
(mellow ambient music)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.417
(chattering)

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.800
- [Annie] I rescued these old videotapes

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.550
when emptying out my grandparents' home.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.700
To think they almost disappeared forever,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.677
with the people in them.

00:01:02.677 --> 00:01:05.070
("Dance for Cello")

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.003
My aunt Nora.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.453
I'd already lost her.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.430
So I saved it where I knew
I'd never lose her again,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.480
at the head of this film.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.730
Nora went to Iceland to play her cello

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.330
and she stayed forever.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.140
She said that in Iceland,
for the first time,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.423
she felt like herself.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.400
I felt that whenever we were together.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.343
Me too, she said, like soulmates.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.680
I keep thinking of that
game we used to play,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.630
what was it called?

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.363
Where you'd lose your way,
and try to find your way back.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:02.245
I keep hoping I'll find you again.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.140
There are so many things left to say.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.270
I found this passage in a book

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.483
and wish I could send it to you.

00:02:14.607 --> 00:02:18.130
"The thing the nature of which
is totally unknown to you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.823
is usually what you need to find,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.417
and finding it is a
matter of getting lost".

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:30.769
(uplifting music)

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.650
(car horns honking)

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.523
Easter, 1999.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.710
I traveled to Rome to
visit my best friend.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.980
While she was busy studying,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.763
I was falling in love with
our other friend, Matt.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.460
(camera shutter clicking)

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.700
A time when it still seemed
possible to get lost.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.163
And my camera, the perfect excuse.

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:13.570
(playful music)

00:03:22.447 --> 00:03:25.447
(car horns honking)

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:33.032
Have you ever had one of
those epiphanic moments?

00:03:34.245 --> 00:03:35.730
You know, when you're least expecting it

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.663
this intuitive thing hits you

00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:41.267
and you know you must
pursue it till the end?

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.023
Mine was here, at the Vatican.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.913
At a hot dog stand, on a lollipop.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.403
Yes, a lollipop.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.130
This would become the first
picture in my collection

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.603
in a film about images.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.073
Back then, staring at the
face of Pope John Paul II,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.983
the holy father, on a giant
rainbow-swirled lollipop,

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.090
I just knew I needed to go to Graceland,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.663
the home of Elvis Presley,
the King of Image.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.037
Matt said, go, see what
you find, I'll join you.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.670
We loaded the car with cameras and friends

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.480
and arrived just in time for Elvis Week.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.160
Super 8 reel one, Memphis,
Tennessee, August 2000.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.093
Graceland was my garden
of earthly delight.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.183
Of pop candy.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.790
What seemed sacrilegious for the Pope

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.093
seemed perfectly reasonable for Elvis.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.980
I found pleasure in every
possible incarnation

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.143
of Elvis's image.

00:05:18.227 --> 00:05:20.810
(bright music)

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.870
I imagined we'd start here, at Graceland,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.480
the house where Elvis lived and died.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.623
But cameras weren't allowed inside.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.083
More on this later, but for
now, I was blissfully naive.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.210
All was not lost.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.580
A fan told us there was
another house Elvis lived in

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.180
before Graceland we could visit.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.420
And so this is where our
story actually begins,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.523
on Audubon Drive, the first
house Elvis bought in Memphis.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.460
It's not open to the public,
but fans come anyway.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.660
And the owners let us join

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.830
the unofficial tour already in progress.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.830
- I'll tell you a little
bit about this room

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.193
and about the house.

00:06:16.452 --> 00:06:18.640
It was built in 1953.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.140
This one was taken right
in front of this fireplace.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.280
I think it's pretty remarkable

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.910
because you can see some
of the dings in the brick,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.300
like right there, that's right there.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.500
I would have just assumed

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.650
that this had happened over the years but,

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.853
yeah, that's the way it was back in 1956.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.440
Mike and I have had a
lot of debates about this

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.170
because Mike thinks-

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.920
- [Annie] I'd never see this
photograph the same again.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.780
Where I once saw Elvis, I'd
forever see a ding, a hole.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.313
Imagine, touching the same ding
Elvis may have once touched.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.970
She left me alone with the
ding for the briefest instant.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:18.683
And yes,

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:21.073
I touched it.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.980
We each marked our discoveries
with our own photographs.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.293
and to think, we were
still shooting on film.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.220
There was still some mystery in that,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.610
not knowing what you
captured, if anything at all.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.700
- [Tour Guide] But you can
get it through Bettyharper.com

00:07:50.306 --> 00:07:52.353
- I don't know if this
thing's gonna work but.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.857
They have recreated that wall

00:07:55.857 --> 00:07:59.720
and they recreated the house
basically to the way it was

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.610
when Gladys used to cook on that stove.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.443
And if you don't believe me,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.547
there's Gladys cooking on the stove!

00:08:08.547 --> 00:08:10.900
(tourists laughing)

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.752
- [Tourist] Look at the
color of the pottery, blue.

00:08:13.752 --> 00:08:16.030
- I'm telling you, they went
through to a lot, you know,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.513
a lot of effort to do this for the fans.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.950
So I live behind Graceland,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.910
my name is Phyllis Presley Collas,

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.620
and you're welcome to come to
my house if you would like.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.620
I live next to Vernon, I'm
in Gary Pepper's house.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.417
- [Tourist] Did you
look at the porch  ?

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:36.255
- Yeah, I have got the sliding glass door,

00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:37.088
it's got the image of Elvis on it.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.383
- [Annie] Meeting Phyllis

00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:41.210
was our first big stroke of luck.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.770
We'll visit her tomorrow,
and see her spirit door,

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.403
but first, it's Friday
night on Beale Street.

00:08:47.426 --> 00:08:49.346
(upbeat music)

00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:51.266
♪ Tutti frutti, oh rooty ♪

00:08:51.266 --> 00:08:55.400
♪ Tutti frutti, oh rooty ♪

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.723
- [Annie] So many Elvises.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.100
Elvis as magnet.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.173
Elvis as clock.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.133
Dancing teddy bear.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.013
Elvis as t-shirt.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.185
- The 2001 Elvis calendar.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.620
- [Annie] Elvis as calendar

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.670
- Two different ones.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.467
Everybody must have the new
Elvis calendar as it comes out.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.290
- [Annie] What is this?
- It's the Elvis baby rattle,

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.473
it says shake rattle and
roll with Elvis on it.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.270
- [Annie] But by chance or fate,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.480
I happened upon something greater.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.670
The very man who took the
legendary picture of the ding,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.840
Alfred Wertheimer.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.140
- Elvis's most famous
photographer right here.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.020
- [Annie] Suddenly Alfred was
surrounded by adoring fans.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.010
His photographs have
become nearly as legendary

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.113
as Elvis himself.

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.760
And though he said he usually gets $1000

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.100
for such interviews, he
said it would be okay

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.460
if we asked him some questions
right there and then.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.980
In the middle of this
crowded souvenir shop,

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.120
in the middle of the night.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.250
- He's on stage, right, he's on stage.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.750
Somebody had just shot off a flashbulb,

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.620
I call this "Starburst", and
it was in sync to my shutter

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.100
and it flared me out and
it made a great picture.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.080
And this is, here, I'm gonna
ask you a few questions,

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.600
what's going on here
with the motorcycle shot,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.500
which is a well known shot?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.730
Why is he looking like that?

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.330
Well, the question was, why
won't the motorcycle start,

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.820
and the answer was, there
was no gas in the tank.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.270
Now Elvis always assumed
somebody's supposed to do it,

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.190
well they didn't, and then
eventually when they got the gas

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.290
the motorcycle worked.

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:46.743
That's the way it is with machinery.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.040
- [Annie] I disagreed.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.230
There were a thousand answers.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.343
His was just one.

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.750
I knew this image.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.150
I'd seen it on watches,
lunch boxes, t-shirts,

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.250
and it was never about running out of gas.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.360
Elvis was only 21, and
there I was, the same age.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.400
I wish I could have asked
Elvis what he'd been thinking.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.403
Whether he knew he was no longer mortal.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.803
I'd never get the chance.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.190
I was born too late, born
the same year Elvis died.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.220
So I'm left searching
his images for clues.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.137
(fans cheering and applauding)

00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:41.044
(camera shutters clicking)

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.330
- Am I gonna sit down?

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.424
First of all, I plead
innocent of all charges.

00:11:51.424 --> 00:11:52.850
(audience laughs)

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:53.750
- [Reporter] Are you satisfied

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.140
with the image you've established?

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.627
- Well the image is one thing

00:11:56.627 --> 00:11:58.530
and human being is another, you know.

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.880
- [Reporter] How close
is the image to the man?

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.730
- It's very hard to live up
to an image, put it that way.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.680
- [Reporter] What about
your image as a shy, humble-

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.730
- [Annie] This too is just an image.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.473
Fragments I perceive as whole.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.250
While the news cut straight to his answer,

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.092
here's what really happened.

00:12:18.092 --> 00:12:19.201
- [Reporter] Are you satisfied

00:12:19.201 --> 00:12:22.034
with the image you've established?

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.160
- [Annie] The answer's not in his words,

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.910
it's in what he does with his head.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.540
The moment Elvis looks behind him,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.356
as if looking for his image, then answers.

00:12:35.356 --> 00:12:38.460
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.660
The perfect answer to
an ambiguous question.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.170
I couldn't stop watching.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.333
This is the Elvis who
would never run out of gas.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.113
His answer invites more questions.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.113
Isn't that the large part of his appeal?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.863
The belief that there's
still yet more to discover?

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.093
It's these in between moments
I find most revealing.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.070
Now that Elvis the person
is no longer alive,

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:17.743
Elvis's image can be whatever
anyone wants it to be.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.593
Perfect, immortal.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.430
It makes a whole new
kind of myth possible.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.543
Creates room for the imagination.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.173
And this is how my voyage
into the unknown began.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.660
I woke up early,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.260
eager to see Elvis's Spirit
Image on Phyllis's door.

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.316
It really is right behind
Graceland, couldn't be any closer.

00:13:44.316 --> 00:13:45.866
But it's not in any guide book.

00:13:52.768 --> 00:13:55.768
(door bell ringing)

00:13:57.569 --> 00:13:58.402
- Come in!

00:13:59.512 --> 00:14:04.360
Hey, welcome to 1288 Dolan
Drive, Memphis Tennessee.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.960
The former of home of Gary Pepper.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.040
Elvis Presley bought this
house for Gary Pepper

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.330
and Elvis spent some
good, quality times here.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.970
So why don't you come on in
and we'll show you around.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.560
- [Annie] Gary Pepper was a
big fan with cerebral palsy

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.486
and they say Elvis looked after him.

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:23.319
- I don't know if you've noted,

00:14:23.319 --> 00:14:25.377
but the doorbell plays
one of Elvis's songs,

00:14:25.377 --> 00:14:27.217
"It's Now or Never."

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.553
Okay.
- Okay.

00:14:31.553 --> 00:14:33.033
- And then you want me
to show some of the?

00:14:33.033 --> 00:14:35.510
- That would be great.
- Okay.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:37.623
Let me take you in the bathroom first.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.640
I have a lot of Elvis fans that come here

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.870
and they're in awe and
they're able to see things

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.020
that they've never seen before.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.430
Some of the photographs
I have are quite rare,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.690
like this one here, shows Elvis in church.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.290
This one here is-

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:57.490
- [Annie] Several years ago

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:00.830
Phyllis left her life in New
Jersey to be closer to Elvis.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.930
She never got to see him in person either.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.210
- And this is something unique

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.340
and it's something I cannot find again

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.003
but this is an Elvis
Presley shower curtain.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.910
- [Annie] I film the bathroom,
and the shower curtain,

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.060
but really just want
to see the glass door.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.410
Phyllis explains that will have to wait,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.810
as "Murder She Wrote" is on.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:35.150
But while she watches, she
allows me to explore on my own.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.910
I do, despite feeling like an intruder,

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.150
shooting her private
things, her unmade bed,

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.543
her family photographs.

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:48.600
What I used to see as kitschy and strange

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.143
now seemed perfectly
normal as Phyllis's things.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.453
Her towel, her pillow.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.940
And Elvis looked at home
on Phyllis's mantel.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.963
Finally the show ends
and our tour reconvenes.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.323
- The other neat feature about
the house is the patio door.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.940
When I moved here it was clear

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:26.450
and as time went on the
image grew and grew and grew

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:30.320
and if you look at it you
see images of Elvis in there.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.413
And the thing constantly
changes, it changes constantly.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.490
- [Annie] And so as not to laugh,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:47.033
I held my breath, tried
to suppress my doubts,

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.653
and tried to appreciate
it for whatever it was.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.150
Strangely wanting to see
him, wanting to believe.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.610
I'm sure it was the heat,
upwards of 100 degrees,

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:08.773
because I think I saw a collar, his hair.

00:17:21.097 --> 00:17:24.460
This is the last time I saw Phyllis.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.170
She passed away a few years later

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.350
and I found myself hoping
the glass door remains,

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.853
exactly as it was.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:38.803
Super 8 reel two.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:42.960
I've been here all week,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.570
but they tell me tonight is the climax,

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.063
the Eve of Elvis's death.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.690
All day we've been
waiting outside Graceland.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.690
Waiting against the wall

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.690
that radiates the day's 100 degree heat.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.923
It's brutal, even to
me, and I'm from Miami.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.523
They speak of sacrifice,
pilgrimage, tradition.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:12.000
I watched them leave
their marks on this wall,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.410
as if speaking directly to Elvis,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.760
as though he could read it.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.450
What is it you like most about it?

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.460
- Best thing, Elvis was born in the south

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.900
and he grew up poor

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.810
and when I was growing up
I didn't have much either

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.100
and he never left his roots,

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.230
he never stayed out in
L.A. or in New York,

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.150
he always came back to
Memphis and the south,

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.203
never gave up on his roots,
and I really love that a lot.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.600
- [Annie] The Pink and Black gals

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.163
who I'd later know as Jerry and Annie.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.320
How long have you been fans?

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.960
- Fans, aw, gee, I've been
a fan since September, 1956,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.423
that first Ed Sullivan show.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.693
I was 13, fell in love instantly.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.360
- [Annie] What made you
fall in love, what part?

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.690
- I don't know, he was there.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.690
I didn't know him and it
was just instant, instant.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:18.750
I can't explain it, I saw
him and I was in love.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.933
And I still am.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.663
I'm married, family, but
there is nothing like Elvis.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.480
- [Annie] Elvis Tape seven.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.160
It's going to be a long night.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.703
Fans begin to stake out their
spots and set up their altars.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.380
Oh, and here on the right
is photographer Ralph Burns,

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.480
who I didn't yet know.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.940
We won't actually meet
until a few years later.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.433
I'd seen a lot, but I
wasn't prepared for this.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.450
As night falls, it's as though
he just died all over again,

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:19.483
but it's 23 years since.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:34.900
One by one they light their
candles from the eternal flame,

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.663
walk up the hill to the grave site.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:46.193
50,000 people here, it
won't end until dawn.

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.683
Till the very last person
has had their chance.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.313
And despite the crowd, you
can still hear the crickets.

00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:07.208
♪ Take my hand ♪
(crickets chirping)

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.850
♪ Take my whole life too ♪

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.280
- [Annie] These are the last images I have

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.033
before I was roughly escorted out.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.293
Again, cameras were not allowed.

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.900
So I traded my camera for a candle,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.483
walked up to his grave site.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.973
Exiting the gates, the
wax burning my hand.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.150
I was about to toss it in the trash,

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.623
when I noticed a woman glaring at me.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.443
I stopped,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.713
noticed the other candles
still burning in the street,

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.433
and placed mine alongside.

00:22:16.806 --> 00:22:19.639
(uplifting music)

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.190
There was more to this connection

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.940
than I could even begin to imagine.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.663
Super 8 reel three.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.010
I felt I had to look further back

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.820
to even begin to understand

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.563
the origins of celebrity, of worship.

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.100
Father Greg tells me that before
Elvis, before celebrities,

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.970
we had Popes and Saints,

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:58.793
their images recognized by everyone.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.900
The subject of stories, pictures, music,

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.450
the popular culture of the day.

00:23:06.317 --> 00:23:10.430
(tourists speaking in foreign language)

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.263
Pope Tape one.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.963
Trinkets, snow globes, ashtrays,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.060
anything you wanted with
the Pope's face on it,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.763
just as I remembered it, not
much different from Graceland.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.600
A shopkeeper tells me,
that's not exactly true.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.390
They don't sell bobblehead
Pope, or Pope soap on a rope,

00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.190
bed sheets, that would be too crass.

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.633
Although every day there
are people asking for them.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.620
I'm curious to know of what
you just bought in the store?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.700
- Well, here we just bought
more calendars and postcards.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.820
My brother calls the Pope
his hero, he lives in Seattle

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.740
and I have a whole lot of other stuff

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.210
but I happened to spot this

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.120
and I thought he'd enjoy
that picture particularly.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.743
So that's goin' to Seattle.

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.797
- [Annie] I told myself I wasn't buying it

00:24:32.797 --> 00:24:34.347
for the same reasons they were.

00:24:35.729 --> 00:24:38.890
(vendor speaking in foreign language)

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.070
He's showing me his wares,

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.723
but I can't stop staring at his cigarette.

00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:49.100
He tells me he's Jewish

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.683
but that selling Pope
souvenirs is an okay living.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.633
And for me?

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.140
I'm also Jewish and I keep
thinking this has something to do

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.913
with my fascination with the
forbidden, the graven image.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.900
There was a woman back in the 700s

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.283
who literally consumed
the images of saints.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.500
She scraped some of the
plaster from the frescoes,

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.383
mixed it with water, and drank
it for its healing powers.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.540
I didn't go that far, but must confess,

00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.903
there was one souvenir I still coveted.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.870
Feeling shy about my Italian,

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:44.335
I asked my friend if she'd get me one.

00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:49.335
(Sabrina and vendor speaking in Italian)

00:25:51.416 --> 00:25:54.083
(playful music)

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.823
She got much more,

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.256
the actual story behind
the now infamous lollipop.

00:26:07.256 --> 00:26:12.256
(Sabrina and vendor speaking in Italian)

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.730
You see the Vatican
licensed the Pope lollipop,

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:27.003
but under one condition,

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.733
there'd be no licking of
the holy father's face!

00:26:33.287 --> 00:26:36.320
(Sabrina and vendor speaking in Italian)

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.279
- So they say that, oh god.
- Oh god.

00:26:40.279 --> 00:26:43.980
(Sabrina laughing)

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.973
- It's like candy, only
this is special probably.

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.200
- [Annie] So wait,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:59.490
if the Vatican licenses Pope lollipops,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:02.240
then they must also
license the rest of it,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.973
and make money off of it,
but how could that be?

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.300
I needed an answer.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.110
- 'Cause it's expensive
to operate this place

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.020
and you gotta get your
money from some place.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.310
There's an economic affairs
branch at the Vatican

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.340
that deals with licensing the papal image

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.930
so that every time the Pope travels

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.310
there will be very complex negotiations

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.220
with local firms and agencies

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.870
about who can and cannot
use the Pope's face,

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.980
who can use the logo of the Vatican.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.960
The balance they're trying
to strike is on the one hand

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.910
they don't want the image
sort of used in ways

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:34.060
that would seem unseemly,
you know, unspiritual.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.220
But on the other hand

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.600
I think they want people to have access.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.600
So that part never bothered me
nor was it a surprise for me.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.210
Part of it is because, you
know, my last assignment

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.327
before I came here was in L.A.

00:27:48.327 --> 00:27:51.480
and L.A. and Rome are both company towns

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.830
and they're about show
business in some ways.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.507
And so that experience

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.773
translated pretty easily into being here.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:02.070
- [Annie] John Allen,

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.623
a reporter from Kansas now
living in Vatican City.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.223
Years from now,

00:28:07.223 --> 00:28:09.980
he'll serve as CNN's Vatican
Expert at the Pope's funeral.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:16.030
I forgot to ask what he thought
about the Papas del Papa,

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.790
the Pope Potato chips with
collectible images of the Pope

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.433
inside each greasy bag.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.850
Just one of the sponsorship
deals the Vatican made

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.653
to fund the Pope's visit to Mexico.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:29.963
It was the same trip

00:28:29.963 --> 00:28:32.200
where the Pope spoke
out against consumerism.

00:28:34.055 --> 00:28:37.888
(singing in foreign language)

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:40.703
Pope tape two.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.530
They're all hoping that Pope John Paul II

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.783
will appear at his window, so
they're singing beneath it.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.523
The world's largest serenade.

00:28:52.839 --> 00:28:56.672
(singing in foreign language)

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:15.706
(fans cheering and singing)

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.300
But we can't get enough.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.723
There's an insatiable appetite
for this man and his image.

00:29:30.922 --> 00:29:35.030
(Pope in foreign language)

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:36.850
I watched as they devoured the Pope

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.683
like they would potato chips.

00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:43.575
(fans cheering and singing)

00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:49.530
- Many times when you see these images,

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.170
the pictures of groups of
people or even individuals

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:56.050
going to the Holy Father,
you see a much bigger smile

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.460
than people would normally have,

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.070
especially if you know
the persons, you know,

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.480
you say, oh my gosh, they're radiating.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.960
And I've seen my own
pictures show the same thing.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.220
- Once when I met the Holy Father I said,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.120
Holy Father, I love you.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.137
And he took his hands like this on my face

00:30:11.137 --> 00:30:12.993
and he said, I love you too.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:15.400
- [Annie] I asked her if
all this media attention

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.910
ever got in the way of the Pope's message.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.900
- That could be that it's the media

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:22.920
that makes the popular thing to do.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.110
But remember that we are
also dealing with a Pope

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:30.110
who is an actor, who, you know,
if the medium is the message

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.540
he understands the importance
of getting a message forth.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.530
And I think the basic
reason why he would accept

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:40.490
the kind of attention that
he gets from the people

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.320
is because it gives him a place, a medium,

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:48.550
an audience, a way, to
again speak the word of God,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.150
because what else does he speak?

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.827
(calm music)

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.160
- [Annie] The image is one thing,

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.670
the human being is another.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.963
I forgot that Pope John
Paul II was once an actor.

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:13.960
And I never knew that the
Vatican has its own media,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.730
it's own radio, TV, newspaper,

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.083
or that nuns also read media theory.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.340
The Media Liaison for
the Vatican tells me,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.150
she's not surprised that
he's known as the media Pope.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.440
And she ventures to
imagine that the next Pope

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.090
will be a difficult role to fill.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.360
She couldn't grant me an
interview with the Pope,

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.133
but she could get me a
spot on the press platform,

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.343
and she did, Pope tape three.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.480
Holy Saturday, the eve of Easter,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.380
one of the holiest nights of the year.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:59.270
I feel flushed, that prickly
heat on the back of my neck

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.553
as I walk past the Swiss
guards to enter the Basilica.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.753
Would they discover my
film was also about Elvis?

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.323
Is that a sacrilege?

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.720
- Let us participate
with an intense communion

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.710
of faith and love in order
to encounter the Lord,

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:27.473
who on this night passes
from death to life.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.420
Let us welcome the Holy Father,

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.610
who in the atrium of the Basilica

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:36.150
is preparing to bless the new fire, light,

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.513
and the paschal candle.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.080
The Basilica will remain
enveloped in darkness,

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.140
only to be gradually enlightened

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.850
by the flame of the paschal candle,

00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.660
a symbol of Christ,
the light of the world.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.220
At this point in the
ceremony you are asked

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.620
to please refrain from
using cameras with flash,

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:58.770
so as not to disrupt Liturgy.

00:33:01.812 --> 00:33:04.729
(cameras clicking)

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:17.125
(uplifting music)

00:33:23.593 --> 00:33:26.510
- [Annie] Is this really happening?

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.403
They told them not to
photograph in five languages.

00:34:15.828 --> 00:34:17.128
Could they not have heard?

00:34:20.513 --> 00:34:24.846
(Pope speaking in foreign language)

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:38.643
How far would we go for a photograph?

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.800
I could think only of those
final images of Princess Diana,

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.993
chased to death just 3 years before.

00:34:57.787 --> 00:34:59.487
That dreadful night in the tunnel.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.583
Even in death, the cameras
were still flashing.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.330
Killed for an image

00:35:12.695 --> 00:35:15.528
(fans chattering)

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.753
Super 8 reel four.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.720
We were each surprised
to see the others there,

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:37.380
at the gates of Kensington Palace.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.363
August 31st 2002, the fifth anniversary.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.440
- When we came here five years ago

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.340
it was an extraordinary,
beautiful few days,

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.330
not in a wet way or pathetic
way or hysterical way.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.210
Some people were calling people

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.390
who were upset about the death
of the Princess hysterical

00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:59.830
and the mob and the rabble.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.960
And people weren't like that at all,

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.150
it was actually a really genuine feeling.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.831
And they weren't using
the death of the Princess

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.534
to make ourselves feel better,

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.830
which I think is a very
cynical way of viewing us.

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:14.440
It's just a genuine human feeling.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.029
- I don't think there's
any boundaries on love,

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:20.800
I mean, it's just like,
I'm a housewife in Florida.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.480
You know, what am I doin'
in England? (chuckles)

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.965
But here I am.

00:36:24.965 --> 00:36:28.610
- [Annie] Maria's not just
a housewife from Florida,

00:36:28.610 --> 00:36:31.240
she's a modest, but gifted poet.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.390
But this reporter will
never find that out.

00:36:35.151 --> 00:36:36.300
- What I call my Diana friends,

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.570
you know, we all just kinda
wanted to get together

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:40.710
and with the world situation,

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.270
I didn't know if I'd
ever get over here again

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.710
so then I wanted to take this opportunity

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.410
to pay my respects to her
and leave my poetry for her.

00:36:48.961 --> 00:36:49.930
So that's what I'm doing.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:52.050
- Are you gonna read
your poetry aloud today?

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.000
- Oh, no, no, but I've got
it over there in a book.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.270
- And do you read it at the gates?

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:00.683
- I might, you never can
tell, but it's on my website.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.883
- I can say your planning to
read the poetry at the gates?

00:37:03.883 --> 00:37:05.780
- I don't know, I hadn't decided.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:07.330
I've just got the poetry over there,

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.100
I'm gonna take the book and leave it

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.093
because I don't want
it to get thrown away.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.390
But it's over there.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.680
- What's your name?

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.653
- Maria Lindberg.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.150
- Maria, L-I-N-D?
- L-I-N-D-B-E-R-G.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.920
- Can I be rude and ask your age?

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.903
- 48, it's not rude.

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:27.956
- And you're from Pensacola, Florida.

00:37:27.956 --> 00:37:29.156
It's your fifth anniversary,

00:37:29.156 --> 00:37:30.390
I've been coming here for five years.

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.735
I want to read my poetry for her.

00:37:32.735 --> 00:37:34.667
- I'm gonna leave my poetry.
- [Annie] Leave her poetry.

00:37:34.667 --> 00:37:36.324
- You're going to leave your poetry.

00:37:36.324 --> 00:37:37.157
- Yes.

00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:40.490
- Is there a little extract of the poetry

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:41.390
we could put in the paper?

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:43.882
- Yeah, it's all over there,

00:37:43.882 --> 00:37:45.290
you can pick out anything you want.

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:48.290
- It's on the gate, can you show us?

00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:54.380
- [Annie] All these messages,

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.830
like those written on the
wall outside Graceland.

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.150
Or prayers left at the
Western Wall in Jerusalem.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.230
This is Terry Hutt, he's the
one who started this ritual

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.020
of tying the flowers and
messages to the gates,

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.220
and now others have
already latched onto it.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.620
Terry taught me not to
be so quick to judge.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.540
Underneath that silly hat,
is a retired carpenter

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:33.340
who volunteers with the
elderly, disabled, and homeless.

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:35.930
He met Princess Diana a couple of times

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.380
through their volunteer work.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.220
- I'm here to help people.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.620
They come with flowers

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:48.620
and they don't come with
tape or string to tie 'em up.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.980
And the reason that I help 'em
is to tie 'em to the railings

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.830
so that people don't lay
them on top of each other.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.510
And I always say to them,
put 'em where you want

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.200
and I'll tie 'em up for you.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.190
And it actually makes a nice display,

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:08.890
the flowers last longer
with the wall holding them

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.560
and they don't get knocked over
and we don't lose messages.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.923
And I think lots of people
really appreciate that.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.480
- [Annie] It still felt like
the beginning of something,

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.893
like witnessing these rituals
forming just before my eyes.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.700
The thing about ritual
is it's always the same,

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.063
one year to the next.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.470
I can jump from one
anniversary to the next

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:44.043
without any notice, like now.

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:48.433
Diana tape 12, the 10th anniversary.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.300
Five years have passed
since the previous shot.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.403
Terry is five years older, we all are.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.810
It feels as though they're
returning her image,

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:10.373
giving it back, an offering,
maybe to alleviate the guilt.

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:22.289
- Okay, ladies and
gentlemen, please remember

00:40:22.289 --> 00:40:24.630
that this is a service for the people,

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:29.360
this is not just a service
on media, so please be civil.

00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:35.497
So, now just one minute to,

00:40:35.497 --> 00:40:40.050
can we try to be reasonably
composed and quiet for a moment

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.343
to collect our thoughts and our minds.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.630
Amen, the Father and Son
and the Holy Spirit, amen.

00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:56.860
- [Annie] And that's where I met Margaret,

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.610
the woman with the red jacket
and the big Diana button.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.310
She says she's known for the
jacket and her collection

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.730
and that people call her
the Loyalist Royalist.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:09.630
Like a groupie, Margaret would show up

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:12.330
for all of Diana's public
engagements to catch a glimpse,

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.400
shake her hand, give her flowers.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.983
- Welcome to Heritage House.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.210
- [Annie] Diana herself
took one good look at her,

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:23.093
smiled and said, Oh, you have got it bad!

00:41:23.117 --> 00:41:26.106
- [Margaret] I'm thinking of having the queen
done in her wedding dress...

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.144
- [Annie] Margaret laughs
when she tells me this.

00:41:29.144 --> 00:41:33.394
(guests laughing and chattering)

00:41:36.294 --> 00:41:38.860
- [Barbara] Oh, you've got
the same poster, Margaret!

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:40.910
- [Margaret] Yes, where
did you get yours from?

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.250
- eBay.
- Oh, right.

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.570
- [Annie] She invited us over to see her house

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.760
which she's converted into

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.710
a Princess Diana themed bed and breakfast,

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.170
something she said that
just sort of happened

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.570
when her children left home.

00:41:55.953 --> 00:41:57.520
- They're going over.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.360
- I have this one.
- Oh, do you?

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.667
Where'd you get it, eBay?
- eBay.

00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:03.523
- [Margaret] You see, I'm not on eBay so.

00:42:07.554 --> 00:42:08.648
- [Annie] What do you think?

00:42:08.648 --> 00:42:10.993
- I thought I had a collection, but wow.

00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:15.908
I mean, they're fabulous.

00:42:21.587 --> 00:42:25.000
Do you think she'd miss
a few items? (laughs)

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.073
Only kidding, only kidding.

00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:33.389
Nothing to see. (chuckles)

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:39.378
- This is the other side
and there's a lot of it.

00:42:39.378 --> 00:42:41.840
See the coach spread across there.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.260
That's also for Jubilee there,

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.933
except for the shelf
where Princess Ann is.

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:50.920
You see, I need a bigger house,

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.530
you can tell I need a
bigger house, can't you?

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:54.823
Or I need a museum.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.670
But this has more or
less taken over my life

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:02.080
in the sense I seem to be
doing it 18 hours a day almost,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.830
it's just when I sleep
I'm not thinking about it.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.020
So, you know, I suppose
it has taken over my life

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.310
but I enjoy it.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.660
I mean, I get called
obsessed and things like that

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.400
but people are obsessed
about football, aren't they?

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.520
Obsessed about cricket,

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.070
so I don't really care
whether they say that on not,

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:18.903
I just carry on.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:25.800
- [Annie] Unlike Margaret,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.700
I'll never get to meet Princess Diana.

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.780
As with Elvis, only the
footage remains.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.350
- [Reporter] For a girl of
19 it was a difficult time,

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.146
although perhaps a necessary demonstration

00:43:37.146 --> 00:43:39.020
of just how great are the pressures

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.987
of living constantly in the public eye.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.550
- [Annie] This is where
the obsession begins.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.710
The moment that Diana the person

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.400
becomes connected with the image.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.430
- [Reporter] We thought
there would be an announcement

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:52.080
on his 32nd birthday but there wasn't

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.240
and he told reporters yesterday
that it may be coming soon.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:58.210
Have you any comment to make about that?

00:43:58.210 --> 00:43:59.043
- No.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.280
- [Annie] Early news footage

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.980
when there were rumors of a
possible royal engagement.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.263
The birth of an image.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.410
I spoke to a news photographer

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:15.820
who covered Princess Diana from
these early days forward.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.670
He tells me how it was
love at first sight.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:19.190
- [Reporter] I remember
when Prince Charles

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.090
announced his engagement,
I sent a telegram

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.450
and saying congratulations.

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.750
- [Annie] She was everything he dreamed

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.963
the Prince would marry,
young, fresh looking.

00:44:29.253 --> 00:44:31.610
He even told the prince himself this.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.970
He tells me,- you never
took a bad picture of her,

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.040
and if you put her on the front page,

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.770
you sell out of newspapers.

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.191
- [Reporter] And I suppose in love.

00:44:40.191 --> 00:44:41.191
- Of course!

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.510
- Whatever in love means.

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.427
(triumphant music)

00:44:55.608 --> 00:44:59.400
- [Reporter] Miles and miles
of billowing, English silk.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.630
She didn't think she was
actually going to be able

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.409
to get on the carriage.

00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:07.371
(fans cheering and applauding)

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.220
- [Reporter] Today the
Prince and Princess of Wales

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:11.840
looked relaxed after
their shipboard honeymoon.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.670
How are you enjoying married life?

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.270
- Highly recommend it.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:16.710
- [Reporter] After their honeymoon

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.350
how did they find Scottish weather?

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:20.943
- [Annie] She did look
happy here, holding hands.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.160
Before I realized it was directed.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.240
- [Reporter] The Princess
limits the constant requests

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:27.690
to hold hands.
- Hold hands!

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.020
- [Reporter] Today the
Prince and Princess of Wales

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.926
looked relaxed after
their shipboard honeymoon.

00:45:33.926 --> 00:45:37.463
How are you enjoying married life?

00:45:37.463 --> 00:45:40.280
- [Reporter] I'm sure Diana
will be a wonderful wife

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.860
to Prince Charles and a
wonderful mother to his children.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.825
- [Reporter] And I suppose in love.

00:45:45.825 --> 00:45:47.625
- [Diana] Of course!

00:45:47.625 --> 00:45:50.542
- [Charles] Whatever in love means.

00:45:51.585 --> 00:45:55.080
(fans cheering and applauding)

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.763
- [Reporter] There was a considerable bond

00:45:56.763 --> 00:45:58.730
between them though.

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:01.340
- [Annie] Today these same
images tell her story.

00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.163
The same moments over and over again.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.710
Always with commentaries by others

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.860
telling us what she's
thinking and feeling.

00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:12.090
As though her image
gave them direct access

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.403
to her innermost thoughts and motivations.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.993
What if for once we could
read these images in silence?

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.663
What truths might they reveal?

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.173
I was surprised to find
myself doing the same.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.220
I believed that I could
see her apprehension,

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:41.603
releasing baby William into
the wild, and to the cameras.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.053
A protective look.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.693
A moment of pride as she plays her part.

00:46:54.127 --> 00:46:57.044
(cameras clicking)

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:07.793
An early distancing from Prince Charles.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.123
What's the expression,
seeing is believing?

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.410
It's this belief that fuels
the need for the next image,

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:26.520
which reveals the next
truth, and the next,

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.593
and the next, and the next.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.286
And that's when things get out of control.

00:47:34.286 --> 00:47:36.869
(upbeat music)

00:47:40.164 --> 00:47:44.265
- I got something, I don't
know if I'll end up using.

00:47:44.265 --> 00:47:48.182
(fans cheering and applauding)

00:48:02.785 --> 00:48:07.368
(moves into "Also Sprach Zarathustra")

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.180
But there were these moments too

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.033
Rare glimpses of Elvis the person.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.730
They say there's an Elvis for everyone

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.763
and tell stories of his
generosity, his accessibility.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.470
How he'd stand outside Graceland

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.533
for hours signing autographs,
posing for photographs.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.500
How he visited kids in the hospital,

00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:42.233
wrote big checks for charities,
paid off people's debts.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:48.193
How he gave away
wheelchairs, cars, houses.

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.423
An Elvis for everyone.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:55.823
I even found mine.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.380
Here he's just having
fun, opening fan mail,

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.900
and pretending this is what they say.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.380
- Dear Elvis, after 15 years
we have finally learned

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.380
to understand what you say on
record, signed RCA. (laughs)

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:14.513
My god, my god, why hast
thou forsaken me? (laughs)

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.597
Signed, the Pope.

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.830
He even looks right at me,

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.080
making sure I caught
the line about the Pope.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.640
How I wish I could have shown him this.

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:33.230
It was one of those things

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.193
that was just too good to be true.

00:50:37.756 --> 00:50:39.497
(bat cracks)
- Whoa, did okay!

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:49.708
Because it was too good to be true.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.100
Years later, I discovered this headshot

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.920
of actor Eugene Greytak.

00:51:03.497 --> 00:51:08.180
It's not the pope after all,
but a papal impersonator.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:09.630
I didn't believe it at first,

00:51:11.028 --> 00:51:12.728
but there was no denying the ears.

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:16.573
I swear I could hear the pope say,

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:22.820
Seeing is one way of knowing,
listening is another.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.033
Go and listen.

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:32.650
Pope tape 20, Ansonia, Connecticut.

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:37.650
- This is another oil of the
Pope that's originally signed.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:43.120
- [Annie] Pete, also known as Polka Pete,

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:46.193
is preparing to donate his
entire collection to a museum.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.060
He told me he recently lost his wife,

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:53.963
but I didn't ask whether his
collection started after.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:57.380
- The Public record newspaper,

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.060
so it's going to the Philadelphia Museum.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.830
What better than having an original sketch

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.900
from a Philadelphia newspaper.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:04.700
- And where'd you find that?
- eBay.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:12.740
But anyhow, that's the famous
picture for here in Ansonia,

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.573
me shaking the Pope's hand.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.310
And I just thought this
would be a memento,

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:19.460
I actually bought two of 'em,

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.890
one to keep at home and
one to go in the museum.

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.100
So I've got a little smarter,
little less expensive stuff,

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.593
maybe I'll buy two and keep some stuff.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.540
This is a wood carving.

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.023
Again, I don't know.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.140
- [Annie] It isn't enough to collect.

00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:38.270
There's this impulse to
share it with others.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.286
A mission to keep this going.

00:52:40.286 --> 00:52:42.295
And so my camera becomes
a way of both cataloging,

00:52:42.295 --> 00:52:43.780
and sharing

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:46.573
Like it's own museum of sorts.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.153
- My favorite item that I
found one time probably,

00:52:51.365 --> 00:52:53.180
it's a beautiful little pin

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.920
and I think this one of the cutest things,

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.150
the Pope is a Polish boy.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.393
But that's what he was, he was Polish boy.

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:01.703
- [Annie] Pete's collection

00:53:01.703 --> 00:53:04.150
seems so intrinsic to who he is.

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:07.620
Like calling himself Polka
Pete and being Polish,

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.193
that I wonder if he'll actually
be able to part with it.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.600
- Hi, there you are.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:20.410
Welcome, come on in and I'll show you my

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:22.280
30 year Elvis collection,

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.553
which we've kinda run outta
room here so, don't be shocked!

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:31.373
- Elvis tape 50.
- Tad bit crowded.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.160
- [Annie] Rockin Robin's
home, San Jose, California.

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:39.543
- I'll show you some things that 
nobody's seen in ages, including myself.

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.773
This is what I used to
do in the early days.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.400
I used to go to all the Elvis concerts

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.150
and I would sneak in my tape recorder.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:50.730
And I would tape all the shows I went

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:52.860
so I had tape of Elvis talking to me.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:56.180
People go, you stuck that in
your purse and taped that?

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.150
- [Annie] Rockin Robin is known

00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:00.330
for having the world's
largest Elvis collection,

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:02.710
over 40,000 items.

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:05.260
Things Elvis actually wore or touched,

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:08.463
scarves, jackets, even his dental records.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:15.340
- And these shows run from Las Vegas, 1972

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.750
all the way through December of 76,

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:22.690
the last three shows
Elvis did in Las Vegas.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:27.503
So I would sneak my tape recorder
in and tape all the shows.

00:54:29.887 --> 00:54:31.790
It brings back great memories

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:34.030
and on one of these tapes
you can hear him say,

00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.120
Rockin' Robin, that's
how I got my nickname.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:41.120
February 3rd, 1974, Las Vegas
midnight show, got a scarf,

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.103
and a kiss, and my new nickname.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.500
All right, I think if
you listen really close.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:56.557
He's in the middle of the stage

00:54:56.557 --> 00:54:58.520
and they start the intro
to "Polk Salad Annie"

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:01.123
and he comes over to me
and he goes, Rockin' Robin.

00:55:10.059 --> 00:55:14.559
("Polk Salad Annie" by Elvis Presley)

00:55:24.915 --> 00:55:26.915
- [Elvis] Rockin' Robin.

00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.000
- I still get chills when I hear that,

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.600
I still get chills when I know

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.067
that he walked over and
went, Rockin' Robin.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.860
- Just grab hold, honey, anywhere.

00:55:38.749 --> 00:55:40.328
There you go.

00:55:40.328 --> 00:55:42.495
Hi, you wanna get serious
or just wait a little bit?

00:55:42.495 --> 00:55:43.420
- [Fan] Yes!

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:46.354
(audience laughs)

00:55:46.354 --> 00:55:48.521
- Whoa, whatsamatter baby?

00:55:50.034 --> 00:55:51.868
(fan sobbing and laughing)

00:55:51.868 --> 00:55:53.360
(audience laughs)

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.960
- [Annie] To be kissed by Elvis.

00:55:57.146 --> 00:55:58.729
- [Fan] I love you!

00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:03.284
- [Annie] Would it feel like this?

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:13.620
While scrubbing through my archive,

00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.973
I happened upon a few unnumbered tapes.

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:20.008
Rare moments when I wasn't
thinking about the film.

00:56:20.008 --> 00:56:22.591
(somber music)

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:25.440
My brother's wedding.

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.853
Matt, my love, who'd come on
every shoot, now shooting me.

00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:36.603
and Nora, she came all
the way from Iceland.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.023
The dance of time.

00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:44.611
A miraculous loop I can play infinitely.

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:58.990
I'm losing count of how many memorials

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:00.843
and Easters there have been.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:05.963
Miscellaneous tape 34,

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.230
where I can no longer
ignore my own obsession.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:11.903
I'm 33 now.

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:15.750
My fiancee Matt

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:19.360
who was there from the very
start of this film, leaves.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.608
And my mom thinks I should
get professional help.

00:57:22.608 --> 00:57:25.450
(soft music)

00:57:25.450 --> 00:57:27.350
I end up on this couch

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:29.800
talking more about the
film than my relationship.

00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:38.223
My analyst tells me a story
of a patient, a hoarder.

00:57:39.429 --> 00:57:41.090
He tells me that when
you're no longer able

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:44.573
to tell what's relevant,
everything becomes significant.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:53.140
I asked if he thought I was losing my way,

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.790
but he's not in the business
of answering questions,

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:56.973
only posing more.

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.050
I did what I do to make sense of my world.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:04.213
I continued shooting,

00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:08.023
joining 800,000 on their
pilgrimage to see the Pope.

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:13.593
Pope tape 43, World Youth Day, Toronto.

00:58:15.297 --> 00:58:19.214
(fans cheering and chattering)

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.610
Why did i think this was a good idea?

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.180
I tried to imagine the one image

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:32.223
that might make this all
worth it, and I couldn't.

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.763
Still, I kept shooting, bearing my cross.

00:58:39.245 --> 00:58:42.380
(rock music)

00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:43.600
The Pope created this event

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.400
to unite the youth around the world.

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:49.660
500,000 now fill this airfield,

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:51.610
for what we sense will be his last one.

00:58:53.807 --> 00:58:57.557
(fans clapping and cheering)

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.863
A newspaper called it 'Popestock',
the Catholic Woodstock.

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:08.920
And I could see why.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.280
Pope tape 44.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.200
- I think the Pope is coming
again to do mass in the morning

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.860
and hopefully we'll get to see him.

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:23.090
I think to night we're
definitely not gonna sleep,

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:25.240
we're gonna be up all night praying

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.986
and singing with other groups,
getting to know other groups,

00:59:28.986 --> 00:59:29.980
we'll definitely not sleep.

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.819
It will just be a big celebration.

00:59:32.819 --> 00:59:35.443
(uplifting music)

00:59:35.443 --> 00:59:36.763
- [Annie] Pope tape 45.

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:42.058
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:54.793
Pope tape 46.

00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.000
Last night, while I found
shelter in the media center,

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.190
this youth group from Boston

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:02.073
camped outside in the rain and mud.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.350
- Right now we're waiting for the pope

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:08.410
and we're not sure if he's coming by.

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:10.400
A lot of us are really
frustrated and tired

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.680
'cause we didn't get a lot of sleep

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:16.500
and we're just kinda waiting
to see if he'll show or.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.740
And these are all these people
behind us blocked our view.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:22.190
And so everyone's kinda
really annoyed right now.

01:00:23.137 --> 01:00:24.979
- It's still really fun going.
- Yeah.

01:00:24.979 --> 01:00:28.610
- Even though we're all soaking
wet and tired and stuff,

01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:31.103
it's still gonna be awesome
no matter what happens.

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.050
- [Annie] Pope tape 47.

01:00:38.643 --> 01:00:41.560
(crowd chattering)

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.896
(fans cheering and applauding)

01:02:01.993 --> 01:02:05.910
(audience cheers and applauds)

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:27.330
- [Annie] We left, filthy and exhausted,

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:29.223
each bearing our own cross.

01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:33.833
but each in our own ways
feeling it was worth it.

01:02:35.094 --> 01:02:37.927
(uplifting music)

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.103
Super 8 reel five.

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.750
This Elvis Week, I finally
made the pilgrimage

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.263
to Elvis's birthplace
in Tupelo, Mississippi.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:58.363
The shotgun shack his father
built, the humble beginnings.

01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.200
I met his old neighbor, Mrs. MacComb.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:05.280
She told me Elvis didn't have a halo.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.900
- [Mrs. MacComb] He was just
Vernon and Gladys's kid.

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:11.320
And he was not a big deal.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.850
But we kept up, I knew all the relatives.

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:15.740
- [Annie] The kid next door.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.483
Hard to imagine now,
that he's cast in bronze.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.113
Elvis tape 33.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.320
It was Joe's first time to Tupelo also,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.063
though he comes every year
to Graceland for Elvis Week.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:36.490
His first trip was with his own father,

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:38.630
and now he brings his son, Kyle,

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.480
who he hopes will carry on
this family tradition one day.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:50.070
When I ask him why he is a
fan, he squirms and says,

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:51.420
because my dad is.

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.073
and He likes Elvis so much, and so do I.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:00.683
He can't explain it, but
isn't that explanation enough?

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.880
- Elvis was born here in this house,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.120
and because of that quirk of fate,

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:13.580
Tupelo may become, if it isn't already,

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.100
the Mecca for rock and roll fans.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.550
Janes Jones was two grades
behind Elvis in school.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.840
She said they were all dirt poor,

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.710
maybe that's why when Elvis
made it big, truckloads of toys

01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.160
starting arriving in
Tupelo every Christmas

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.780
for the town's needy kids.

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:31.180
- Of course it was anonymously,

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.550
but everybody knew who was sending it,

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:37.140
it came from Memphis
so it had to be Elvis.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.233
- [Reporter] What has his
death meant to Tupelo?

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:42.460
- Ain't no way we can say what we feel.

01:04:45.901 --> 01:04:46.734
Well, it's  . . .

01:04:48.433 --> 01:04:51.900
it's like your own family has died.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.900
- [Reporter] What did your daughter say?

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.467
- She said, mama, it's
like God himself died.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.797
("Also Sprach Zarathustra")

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:20.550
- [Annie] Images of the
King World Championship,

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.093
The Holiday Inn, Memphis, Tennessee.

01:05:27.609 --> 01:05:30.192
(lively music)

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.940
To be named the Ultimate
Image of the King,

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:39.223
one must bring the crowd closer to Elvis.

01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:41.503
Elvis tape 95.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.240
I shot five tapes worth of
belt buckles, sideburns,

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.203
gyrating hips, karate
moves, rings, and jumpsuits.

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:54.910
I just couldn't help myself.

01:05:56.815 --> 01:05:59.860
(lively music)

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.290
And found it unbelievable
that fans treasured

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:04.800
the sweat doused scarves of impersonators,

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.458
just as they had Elvis's.

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:10.091
Look at this.

01:06:13.957 --> 01:06:18.948
♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪

01:06:21.006 --> 01:06:22.266
- [Annie] I remember Elvis once saying

01:06:22.266 --> 01:06:24.276
that fans just wanted pieces of him

01:06:24.276 --> 01:06:25.881
for souvenirs, that's all.

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:31.217
(impersonator singing)

01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:33.187
Maybe that's all.

01:06:36.338 --> 01:06:39.588
(impersonator singing "Teddy Bear")

01:06:48.488 --> 01:06:50.130
- Elvis!

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:53.380
(impersonator singing)

01:06:58.228 --> 01:07:02.145
(audience cheers and applauds)

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.170
- [Annie] It was backstage
where I discovered

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:11.633
why this event is called
Images of the King.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.420
They can't even use Elvis's name,

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.570
out of fear of being
pursued by his estate.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.703
And that's the craziest
thing of all, catch that?

01:07:24.610 --> 01:07:27.973
Some already have been sued, and for what?

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:31.580
I learned they don't make
any money doing this.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:34.560
They just want to show the
world how great Elvis was,

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.417
pass him on to the next
generation, like others I'd met.

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:43.550
This guy tells me he never
really got the whole Elvis thing

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:47.080
until he saw an impersonator
who made him wonder,

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.703
was Elvis really this good?

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:58.093
He looked into it and discovered,
Elvis was even better.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.880
He's been performing Elvis ever since.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.270
And it reminded me of the first time

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:08.793
I fell in love with Elvis.

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:15.453
In a book of Kata
Billups's Elvis paintings.

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.053
Her Elvis is infinite.

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:27.713
And one day, she invited me to
her studio in South Carolina.

01:08:29.956 --> 01:08:34.340
- This one is called "Jesus
Taught Elvis to Cook."

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.540
- [Annie] Elvis tape 99.

01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:39.030
- [Kata] Which could've really happened.

01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:41.663
It's kind of a modern day mythology.

01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:48.970
This is called, "I Saw Elvis
on the Bumper Car Rides

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:50.650
at the County Fair."

01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:51.700
- [Annie] Kata said that Graceland

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:54.260
has a way of sanitizing his image,

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.410
to a point where
everything looks the same.

01:08:57.547 --> 01:09:00.677
- "I Saw Elvis Working Shoe Land."

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:16.670
This one is called 'I
Saw Elvis by the Roadside

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:18.587
Selling Velvet Paintings."

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.273
Susan Sarandon owns the
original painting of this.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.450
- [Annie] Off camera,
Kata revealed that she too

01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:40.240
had received a cease and desist letter,

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.270
and it scared her enough
to stop showing her work

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:43.573
for a couple years.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.800
But could it really be so wrong

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.763
to interpret what Elvis means to you?

01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:51.292
- [Reporter] Are you satisfied

01:09:51.292 --> 01:09:52.569
with the image you've established?

01:09:52.569 --> 01:09:53.607
- Well, the image is one thing

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:55.833
and the human being is another.

01:09:55.833 --> 01:09:57.659
- [Reporter] How close
is the image to the man?

01:09:57.659 --> 01:10:00.863
- [Annie] So, there's
something I'm not telling you.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.723
A subplot I've chosen to ignore.

01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.853
I'm not licensed either.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.553
I keep going but always
with this lingering fear,

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:14.833
could Elvis's estate shut me down?

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.020
They say there can be only
one documentary about Elvis,

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:30.020
their own, one musical, only
one official Vegas show,

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.163
only one Elvis.

01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:36.980
Because they claim ownership of Elvis,

01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:40.713
his name, his image, his likeness.

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:50.340
Name, image, and likeness,
what does that even mean?

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.620
Because all these decades since his death,

01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:00.103
Elvis has become an image, an idea,

01:11:01.529 --> 01:11:03.513
that sits in each of our brains.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:07.373
Can't there be room for everyone's Elvis?

01:11:10.658 --> 01:11:13.075
(calm music)

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.726
Elvis as America.

01:11:23.726 --> 01:11:25.351
As patriot.

01:11:25.351 --> 01:11:28.018
As companion.

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:33.018
Elvis as French, and Elvis as Cowboy.

01:11:33.337 --> 01:11:35.170
As sweatered.

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:37.252
As lover.

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:39.452
As a life ring, as savior

01:11:40.452 --> 01:11:41.285
As saint.

01:11:43.570 --> 01:11:44.423
As martyred.

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:52.735
Maybe our images of Elvis
say more about us than him.

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:57.206
It's how we internalize Elvis.

01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:05.603
All three of my icons,
Elvis, the Pope, and Diana,

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.763
have become ideas,

01:12:11.603 --> 01:12:14.519
part of the landscape.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.843
How can you own something
so big, so undefinable?

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.037
So much a part of who we are?

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:48.967
(door thuds)

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:56.333
It's strange to think
of Elvis as property.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:13:02.123
Something that can be bought,
sold, controlled, removed.

01:13:08.526 --> 01:13:11.359
(thunder booming)

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:17.603
I had a dream last night.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.903
A nightmare actually.

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.020
I dreamt the Elvis police
came in the dead of night

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.513
and seized all of the film.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:31.773
They returned, later,
dropping off the remains.

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:36.763
Not a trace was left of Elvis.

01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:41.690
Panicked, I went to bury the remains

01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:43.233
in an undisclosed location.

01:13:45.264 --> 01:13:47.847
(somber music)

01:13:53.048 --> 01:13:55.310
But it wasn't enough for them.

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:58.163
Bloodthirsty, they went after others too.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.683
Seizing original paintings,
drawings, t-shirts,

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.140
and delivered the loot to Dracula himself.

01:14:07.264 --> 01:14:11.014
(moves to suspenseful music)

01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:19.543
- [Therapist] That must be unsettling

01:14:19.543 --> 01:14:21.890
after all the time you've invested in it.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:24.490
To think you might not be
able to complete the film.

01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:27.203
What do you think you're gonna do?

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:33.560
(voice begins to echo)

01:14:38.330 --> 01:14:39.533
- [Annie] Pope tape 73.

01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:43.780
It's Easter and I'm back at the Vatican

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.730
for no other reason than it's
another Easter with the Pope.

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:50.713
My family no longer expects
me home for Passover.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.510
I managed to get tickets to what they call

01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:57.183
a private audience with the Pope.

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:01.370
but It wasn't as private as I imagined it.

01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:08.050
I imagined we'd get to
exchange a few words.

01:15:10.175 --> 01:15:14.092
(fans cheering and applauding)

01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.443
But instead, he just passed right by me.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.230
Leaving barely a trace.

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:38.470
The truth is, when I stopped looking,

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.470
things began revealing themselves to me.

01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:45.540
Like, later that night when I
stumbled into this little bar,

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.873
and there was Elvis again
in the form of a cover band.

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.740
I'm used to him following
me everywhere now.

01:15:55.630 --> 01:15:56.773
Pope tape 56.

01:15:58.645 --> 01:16:03.645
(♪ I'm all Shook Up ♪)
(audience cheers and applauds)

01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:15.870
Floriana started telling me

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:18.530
about how she first discovered Elvis,

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:20.753
and we slipped outside to
hear each other better.

01:16:22.485 --> 01:16:27.152
(Floriana speaking in Italian)

01:17:10.185 --> 01:17:15.018
Then later that night over a
coffee, I almost missed this.

01:17:17.156 --> 01:17:20.223
- Everything comes from
the loneliness and sorrows.

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:26.060
I think that all human beings
have a big hole in the soul

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:29.770
and when you felt alone,
you look for something

01:17:31.132 --> 01:17:34.093
that could fill it.

01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:38.883
Probably is strange or is
sad that Elvis could do that,

01:17:38.883 --> 01:17:42.463
I don't know, but I felt
alone and Elvis was there.

01:17:44.352 --> 01:17:46.769
(soft music)

01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.100
- [Annie] Photographer Ralph Burns

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.100
has been collecting images
of Elvis even longer.

01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.360
Over 40 years.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:16.253
- I'm sort of overwhelmed.

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:19.093
- [Annie] He's become a good friend.

01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:22.870
I asked him if he ever solved the mystery

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:24.560
and he just smiled and said,

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.360
why do you think I keep coming back?

01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:30.723
- File cabinet drawers full of negatives.

01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:34.500
And many of them I've not
really spent any time with yet

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:39.040
so I'm actually both looking forward to

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.643
and dreading on another level.

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:49.650
- [Annie] More than anyone,

01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:50.960
Ralph understands what it's like

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:53.700
to stay with one subject for so long.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:57.053
Still shooting on film,
developing the work by hand.

01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:04.160
To me, his images get closest

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.160
to that unknown thing I've been seeking.

01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:09.300
And I asked him if he'd sit

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.050
and try to put all this into words,

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.850
all the things I've never been able to.

01:19:15.450 --> 01:19:19.770
- I go there looking
for things which to me

01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:22.980
reveal something about all of us.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:26.833
How we interrelate with the beyond.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:32.100
And I keep going back thinking
I'm going to find an answer

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.470
or that there is some definitive image

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:35.853
that's gonna sum this up.

01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:40.980
There's never a photograph
that's gonna capture this

01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:44.740
because it's not about the
obvious, it's about the subtle

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.493
and the mysterious and the mystical.

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:50.290
And maybe I go back for that, too.

01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:56.410
And I've got a deep
appreciation of these fans

01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.873
who come year after year
because of a deep abiding,

01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:05.663
now lost love, for another human being.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:09.273
- [Annie] A deep abiding, now lost love,

01:20:10.530 --> 01:20:11.730
for another human being.

01:20:12.844 --> 01:20:15.427
♪ Wise men say ♪

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.370
- [Annie] They were human beings too,

01:20:21.090 --> 01:20:22.640
and knew what it meant to love.

01:20:24.610 --> 01:20:25.553
Just listen.

01:20:26.506 --> 01:20:30.756
♪ But I can't help falling in love ♪

01:20:36.027 --> 01:20:38.653
- But it's hard now to see
this as an image of love,

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:41.023
without seeing loss.

01:20:47.527 --> 01:20:50.360
(uplifting music)

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:00.410
We watched as the Pope
received a feeding tube,

01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:01.510
could no longer speak.

01:21:02.682 --> 01:21:05.640
(cello playing "Elgar")

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:09.103
As Elvis retreated from
the day, into the night.

01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:16.883
As Diana desperately sought privacy.

01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:20.813
Their suffering.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.133
Our guilt.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:34.930
We'll never know which images

01:21:34.930 --> 01:21:38.083
flashed before their eyes in
their final moments, if any.

01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:41.663
I have only their last pictures.

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:51.300
(church bells ringing)

01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:01.873
I came as soon as I heard the news,

01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:04.853
knowing I had to be here.

01:22:08.589 --> 01:22:11.422
(uplifting music)

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:26.393
And here I am, on the very spot
I stood all those years ago.

01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:42.193
Only this time, he was gone.

01:22:51.589 --> 01:22:54.422
(uplifting music)

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.250
I'm packing to leave

01:23:23.250 --> 01:23:25.623
and watching the funeral again on the TV.

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:28.660
And it's like it's not over.

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:36.450
No matter how long I
spent with the Faithful,

01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:37.753
how much I listened,

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.640
I never did quite actually understand them

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:46.483
until I lost the person who
was that important to me.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.463
My aunt Nora fell quite ill.

01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.080
She suffered for so long.

01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:06.463
Doctors were of little help.

01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:11.543
I called but never visited.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.140
How hard would it have been
to have gotten on a plane?

01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:24.023
She ended her own suffering.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.603
Took her own life.

01:24:32.224 --> 01:24:34.391
Now there's nothing to do.

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:37.680
Nothing but memorialize her in a film.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.103
("Dance for Cello")

01:24:55.458 --> 01:24:58.750
I learned that even death has no ending.

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:00.883
That grief never goes away.

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.580
There will always be unanswered questions.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:28.533
Elvis tape 125.

01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:34.223
Elvis was only 42.

01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:39.920
Hard to believe now that I am, too.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.623
My last Elvis Vigil.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.100
I shot just one tape.

01:25:53.977 --> 01:25:56.810
(uplifting music)

01:26:29.798 --> 01:26:33.298
(moves into lively music)

01:27:00.134 --> 01:27:04.134
(audience cheers and applauds)
