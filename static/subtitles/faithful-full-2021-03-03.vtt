1
00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:31.727
(mellow ambient music)

2
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.617
(chattering)

3
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Annie>I rescued this old videotape</v>

4
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.750
when emptying out my grandparents' home.

5
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.900
To think it almost disappeared forever,

6
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.877
with the people in them.

7
00:01:11.877 --> 00:01:14.270
("Dance for Cello")

8
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.203
My aunt Nora.

9
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.653
I'd already lost her.

10
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.630
So I saved it where I knew I'd never lose her again,

11
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.680
at the head of this film.

12
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.930
Nora went to Iceland to play her cello

13
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.530
and she stayed forever.

14
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.340
She said that in Iceland, for the first time,

15
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.623
she felt like herself.

16
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.600
I felt that whenever we were together.

17
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.543
Me too, she said, like soulmates.

18
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.880
I keep thinking of that game we used to play,

19
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.830
what was it called?

20
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.563
Where you'd lose your way, and try to find your way back.

21
00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:11.445
I keep hoping I'll find you again.

22
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.340
There are so many things left to say.

23
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.470
I found this passage in a book

24
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.683
and wish I could send it to you.

25
00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:27.330
"The thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you

26
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.023
is usually what you need to find,

27
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.617
and finding it is a matter of getting lost".

28
00:02:37.136 --> 00:02:39.969
(uplifting music)

29
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.850
(car horns honking)

30
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.723
Easter, 1999.

31
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.910
I traveled to Rome to visit my best friend.

32
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.180
While she was busy studying,

33
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.963
I was falling in love with our other friend, Matt.

34
00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.660
(camera shutter clicking)

35
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.900
A time when it still seemed possible to get lost.

36
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.363
And my camera, the perfect excuse.

37
00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:22.770
(playful music)

38
00:03:31.647 --> 00:03:34.647
(car horns honking)

39
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:42.232
Have you ever had one of those epiphanic moments?

40
00:03:43.445 --> 00:03:44.930
You know, when you're least expecting it

41
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.863
this intuitive thing hits you

42
00:03:48.047 --> 00:03:50.467
and you know you must pursue it till the end?

43
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.223
Mine was here, at the Vatican.

44
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.113
At a hot dog stand, on a lollipop.

45
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.603
Yes, a lollipop.

46
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.330
This would become the first picture in my collection

47
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.803
in a film about images.

48
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.273
Back then, staring at the face of Pope John Paul II,

49
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.183
the holy father, on a giant rainbow-swirled lollipop,

50
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.290
I just knew I needed to go to Graceland,

51
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.863
the home of Elvis Presley, the King of Image.

52
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.237
Matt said, go, see what you find, I'll join you.

53
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.870
We loaded the car with cameras and friends

54
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.680
and arrived just in time for Elvis Week.

55
00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.360
Super 8 reel one, Memphis, Tennessee, August 2000.

56
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.293
Graceland was my garden of earthly delight.

57
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.383
Of pop candy.

58
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.990
What seemed sacrilegious for the Pope

59
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.293
seemed perfectly reasonable for Elvis.

60
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.180
I found pleasure in every possible incarnation

61
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.343
of Elvis's image.

62
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.010
(bright music)

63
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.070
I imagined we'd start here, at Graceland,

64
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.680
the house where Elvis lived and died.

65
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.823
But cameras weren't allowed inside.

66
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.283
More on this later, but for now, I was blissfully naive.

67
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.410
All was not lost.

68
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.780
A fan told us there was another house Elvis lived in

69
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.380
before Graceland we could visit.

70
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.620
And so this is where our story actually begins,

71
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.723
on Audubon Drive, the first house Elvis bought in Memphis.

72
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.660
It's not open to the public, but fans come anyway.

73
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.860
And the owners let us join

74
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.030
the unofficial tour already in progress.

75
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.030
<v ->I'll tell you a little bit about this room</v>

76
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.393
and about the house.

77
00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:27.840
It was built in 1953.

78
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.340
This one was taken right in front of this fireplace.

79
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.480
I think it's pretty remarkable

80
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.110
because you can see some of the dings in the brick,

81
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.500
like right there, that's right there.

82
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.700
I would have just assumed

83
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.850
that this had happened over the years but,

84
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.053
yeah, that's the way it was back in 1956.

85
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.640
Mike and I have had a lot of debates about his

86
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.370
because Mike thinks-

87
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Annie>I'd never see this photograph the same again.</v>

88
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:12.980
Where I once saw Elvis, I'd forever see a ding, a hole.

89
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.513
Imagine, touching the same ding Elvis may have once touched.

90
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.170
She left me alone with the ding for the briefest instant.

91
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.883
And yes,

92
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:30.273
I touched it.

93
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.180
We each marked our discoveries with our own photographs.

94
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.493
and to think, we were still shooting on film.

95
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.420
There was still some mystery in that,

96
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.810
not knowing what you captured, if anything at all.

97
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.900
<v Tour Guide>But you can get it through Bettyharper.com</v>

98
00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:01.553
<v ->I don't know if this thing's gonna work but.</v>

99
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.057
They have recreated that wall

100
00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:08.920
and they recreated the house basically to the way it was

101
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.810
when Gladys used to cook on that stove.

102
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.643
And if you don't believe me,

103
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.747
there's Gladys cooking on the stove!

104
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:20.100
(tourists laughing)

105
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.952
<v Tourist>Look at the color of the pottery, blue.</v>

106
00:08:22.952 --> 00:08:25.230
<v ->I'm telling you, they went through to a lot, you know,</v>

107
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.713
a lot of effort to do this for the fans.

108
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:33.150
So I live behind Graceland,

109
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.110
my name is Phyllis Presley Collas,

110
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.820
and you're welcome to come to my house if you would like.

111
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.820
I live next to Vernon, I'm in Gary Pepper's house.

112
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.617
<v Tourist>Did you look at the porch tour?</v>

113
00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:45.455
<v ->Yeah, I have got the sliding glass door,</v>

114
00:08:45.455 --> 00:08:46.288
it's got the image of Elvis on it.

115
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.583
<v Annie>Meeting Phyllis</v>

116
00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:50.410
was our first big stroke of luck.

117
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.970
We'll visit her tomorrow, and see her spirit door,

118
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.603
but first, it's Friday night on Beale Street.

119
00:08:56.626 --> 00:08:58.546
(upbeat music)

120
00:08:58.546 --> 00:09:00.466
♪ Tutti frutti, oh rooty ♪

121
00:09:00.466 --> 00:09:04.600
♪ Tutti frutti, oh rooty ♪

122
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.923
<v Annie>So many Elvises.</v>

123
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.300
Elvis as magnet.

124
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.373
Elvis as clock.

125
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.333
Dancing teddy bear.

126
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.213
Elvis as t-shirt.

127
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.385
<v ->The 2001 Elvis calendar.</v>

128
00:09:24.385 --> 00:09:25.820
<v Annie>Elvis as calendar</v>

129
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.870
<v ->Two different ones.</v>

130
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.667
Everybody must have the new Elvis calendar as it comes out.

131
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.490
<v Annie>What is this?</v>
<v ->It's the Elvis baby rattle,</v>

132
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.673
it says shack rattle and roll with Elvis on it.

133
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.470
<v Annie>But by chance or fate,</v>

134
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.680
I happened upon something greater.

135
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.870
The very man who took the legendary picture of the ding,

136
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.040
Alfred Wertheimer.

137
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.340
<v ->Elvis's most famous photographer right here.</v>

138
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.220
<v Annie>Suddenly Alfred was surrounded by adoring fans.</v>

139
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.210
His photographs have become nearly as legendary

140
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.313
as Elvis himself.

141
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.960
And though he said he usually gets $1000

142
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.300
for such interviews, he said it would be okay

143
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.660
if we asked him some questions right there and then.

144
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.180
In the middle of this crowded souvenir shop,

145
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.320
in the middle of the night.

146
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.450
<v ->He's on stage, right, he's on stage.</v>

147
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.950
Somebody had just shot off a flashbulb,

148
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.820
I call this "Starburst", and it was in sync to my shutter

149
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.300
and it flared me out and it made a great picture.

150
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.280
And this is, here, I'm gonna ask you a few questions,

151
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.800
what's going on here with the motorcycle shot,

152
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.700
which is a well known shot?

153
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.930
Why is he looking like that?

154
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.530
Well, the question was, why won't the motorcycle start,

155
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.020
and the answer was, there was no gas in the tank.

156
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.470
Now Elvis always assumed somebody's supposed to do it,

157
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.390
well they didn't, and then eventually when they got the gas

158
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.490
the motorcycle worked.

159
00:10:53.427 --> 00:10:55.943
That's the way it is with machinery.

160
00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.240
<v Annie>I disagreed.</v>

161
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.430
There were a thousand answers.

162
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.543
His was just one.

163
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.950
I knew this image.

164
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.350
I'd seen it on watches, lunch boxes, t-shirts,

165
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.450
and it was never about running out of gas.

166
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.560
Elvis was only 21, and there I was, the same age.

167
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.600
I wish I could have asked Elvis what he'd been thinking.

168
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.603
Whether he knew he was no longer mortal.

169
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.003
I'd never get the chance.

170
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.390
I was born too late, born the same year Elvis died.

171
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.420
So I'm left searching his images for clues.

172
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.337
(fans cheering and applauding)

173
00:11:46.661 --> 00:11:50.244
(camera shutters clicking)

174
00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.530
<v ->Am I gonna sit down?</v>

175
00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.624
First of all, I plead innocent of all charges.

176
00:12:00.624 --> 00:12:02.050
(audience laughs)

177
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Reporter>Are you satisfied</v>

178
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.340
with the image you've established?

179
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.827
<v ->Well the image is one thing</v>

180
00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:07.730
and human being is another, you know.

181
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.080
<v Reporter>How close is the image to the man?</v>

182
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.930
<v ->It's very hard to live up to an image, put it that way.</v>

183
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.880
<v Reporter>What about your image as a shy, humble-</v>

184
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.930
<v Annie>This too is just an image.</v>

185
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.673
Fragments I perceive as whole.

186
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.450
While the news cut straight to his answer,

187
00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.292
here's what really happened.

188
00:12:27.292 --> 00:12:28.401
<v Reporter>Are you satisfied</v>

189
00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:31.234
with the image you've established?

190
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.360
<v Annie>The answer's not in his words,</v>

191
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:37.110
it's in what he does with his head.

192
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.740
The moment Elvis looks behind him,

193
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.556
as if looking for his image, then answers.

194
00:12:44.556 --> 00:12:47.660
(audience cheers and applauds)

195
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.860
The perfect answer to an ambiguous question.

196
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.370
I couldn't stop watching.

197
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.533
This is the Elvis who would never run out of gas.

198
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.313
His answer invites more questions.

199
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.313
Isn't that the large part of his appeal?

200
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.063
The belief that there's still yet more to discover?

201
00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.293
It's these in between moments I find most revealing.

202
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.270
Now that Elvis the person is no longer alive,

203
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.943
Elvis's image can be whatever anyone wants it to be.

204
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:29.793
Perfect, immortal.

205
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.630
It makes a whole new kind of myth possible.

206
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.743
Creates room for the imagination.

207
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.373
And this is how my voyage into the unknown began.

208
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.860
I woke up early,

209
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.460
eager to see Elvis's Spirit Image on Phyllis's door.

210
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.516
It really is right behind Graceland, couldn't be any closer.

211
00:13:53.516 --> 00:13:55.066
But it's not in any guide book.

212
00:14:01.968 --> 00:14:04.968
(door bell ringing)

213
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:07.602
<v ->Come in!</v>

214
00:14:08.712 --> 00:14:13.560
Hey, welcome to 1288 Dolan Drive, Memphis Tennessee.

215
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.160
The former of home of Gary Pepper.

216
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.240
Elvis Presley bought this house for Gary Pepper

217
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.530
and Elvis spent some good, quality times here.

218
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.170
So why don't you come on in and we'll show you around.

219
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.760
<v Annie>Gary Pepper was a big fan with cerebral palsy</v>

220
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.686
and they say Elvis looked after him.

221
00:14:31.686 --> 00:14:32.519
<v ->I don't know if you've noted,</v>

222
00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:34.577
but the doorbell plays one of Elvis's songs,

223
00:14:34.577 --> 00:14:36.417
"It's Now or Never."

224
00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.753
Okay.
<v ->Okay.</v>

225
00:14:40.753 --> 00:14:42.233
<v ->And then you want me to show some of the?</v>

226
00:14:42.233 --> 00:14:44.710
<v ->That would be great.</v>
<v ->Okay.</v>

227
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.823
Let me take you in the bathroom first.

228
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.840
I have a lot of Elvis fans that come here

229
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:55.070
and they're in awe and they're able to see things

230
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:57.220
that they've never seen before.

231
00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.630
Some of the photographs I have are quite rare,

232
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.890
like this one here, shows Elvis in church.

233
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.490
This one here is-

234
00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.690
<v Annie>Several years ago</v>

235
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.030
Phyllis left her life in New Jersey to be closer to Elvis.

236
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.130
She never got to see him in person either.

237
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.410
<v ->And this is something unique</v>

238
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.540
and it's something I cannot find again

239
00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:23.203
but this is an Elvis Presley shower curtain.

240
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.110
<v Annie>I film the bathroom, and the shower curtain,</v>

241
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.260
but really just want to see the glass door.

242
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.610
Phyllis explains that will have to wait,

243
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.010
as "Murder She Wrote" is on.

244
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.350
But while she watches, she allows me to explore on my own.

245
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.110
I do, despite feeling like an intruder,

246
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.350
shooting her private things, her unmade bed,

247
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:52.743
her family photographs.

248
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.800
What I used to see as kitschy and strange

249
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.343
now seemed perfectly normal as Phyllis's things.

250
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.653
Her towel, her pillow.

251
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.140
And Elvis looked at home on Phyllis's mantle.

252
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.163
Finally the show ends and our tour reconvenes.

253
00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.523
<v ->The other neat feature about the house is the patio door.</v>

254
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.140
When I moved here it was clear

255
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.650
and as time went on the image grew and grew and grew

256
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:39.520
and if you look at it you see images of Elvis in there.

257
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.613
And the thing constantly changes, it changes constantly.

258
00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.690
<v Annie>And so as not to laugh,</v>

259
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.233
I held my breath, tried to suppress my doubts,

260
00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.853
and tried to appreciate it for whatever it was.

261
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.350
Strangely wanting to see him, wanting to believe.

262
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.810
I'm sure it was the heat, upwards of 100 degrees,

263
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.973
because I think I saw a collar, his hair.

264
00:17:30.297 --> 00:17:33.660
This is the last time I saw Phyllis.

265
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.370
She passed away a few years later

266
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.550
and I found myself hoping the glass door remains,

267
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.053
exactly as it was.

268
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:48.003
Super 8 reel two.

269
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.160
I've been here all week,

270
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.770
but they tell me tonight is the climax,

271
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.263
the Eve of Elvis's death.

272
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.890
All day we've been waiting outside Graceland.

273
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:02.890
Waiting against the wall

274
00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:04.890
that radiates the day's 100 degree heat.

275
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.123
It's brutal, even to me, and I'm from Miami.

276
00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.723
They speak of sacrifice, pilgrimage, tradition.

277
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:21.200
I watched them leave their marks on this wall,

278
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.610
as if speaking directly to Elvis,

279
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.960
as though he could read it.

280
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.650
What is it you like most about it?

281
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.660
<v ->Best thing, Elvis was born in the south</v>

282
00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.100
and he grew up poor

283
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.010
and when I was growing up I didn't have much either

284
00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.300
and he never left his roots,

285
00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.430
he never stayed out in L.A. or in New York,

286
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:49.350
he always came back to Memphis and the south,

287
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.403
never gave up on his roots, and I really love that a lot.

288
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.800
<v Annie>The Pink and Black gals</v>

289
00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.363
who I'd later know as Jerry and Annie.

290
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.520
How long have you been fans?

291
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.160
<v ->Fans, aw, gee, I've been a fan since September, 1956,</v>

292
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.623
that first Ed Sullivan show.

293
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.893
I was 13, fell in love instantly.

294
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.560
<v Annie>What made you fall in love, what part?</v>

295
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.890
<v ->I don't know, he was there.</v>

296
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.890
I didn't know him and it was just instant, instant.

297
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:27.950
I can't explain it, I saw him and I was in love.

298
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.133
And I still am.

299
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.863
I'm married, family, but there is nothing like Elvis.

300
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.680
<v Annie>Elvis Tape seven.</v>

301
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.360
It's going to be a long night.

302
00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.903
Fans begin to stake out their spots and set up their altars.

303
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.580
Oh, and here on the right is photographer Ralph Burns,

304
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.680
who I didn't yet know.

305
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.140
We won't actually meet until a few years later.

306
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:19.633
I'd seen a lot, but I wasn't prepared for this.

307
00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:25.650
As night falls, it's as though he just died all over again,

308
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.683
but it's 23 years since.

309
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:44.100
One by one they light their candles from the eternal flame,

310
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.863
walk up the hill to the grave site.

311
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:55.393
50,000 people here, it won't end until dawn.

312
00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.883
Till the very last person has had their chance.

313
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.513
And despite the crowd, you can still hear the crickets.

314
00:21:11.408 --> 00:21:16.408
♪ Take my hand ♪
(crickets chirping)

315
00:21:17.633 --> 00:21:21.050
♪ Take my whole life too ♪

316
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.480
<v Annie>These are the last images I have</v>

317
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.233
before I was roughly escorted out.

318
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.493
Again, cameras were not allowed.

319
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:36.100
So I traded my camera for a candle,

320
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.683
walked up to his grave site.

321
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.173
Exiting the gates, the wax burning my hand.

322
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.350
I was about to toss it in the trash,

323
00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.823
when I noticed a woman glaring at me.

324
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:01.643
I stopped,

325
00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.913
noticed the other candles still burning in the street,

326
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.633
and placed mine alongside.

327
00:22:26.006 --> 00:22:28.839
(uplifting music)

328
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.390
There was more to this connection

329
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.140
than I could even begin to imagine.

330
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.863
Super 8 reel three.

331
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.210
I felt I had to look further back

332
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:53.020
to even begin to understand

333
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.763
the origins of celebrity, of worship.

334
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.300
Father Greg tells me that before Elvis, before celebrities,

335
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.170
we had Popes and Saints,

336
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.993
their images recognized by everyone.

337
00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.100
The subject of stories, pictures, music,

338
00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.650
the popular culture of the day.

339
00:23:15.517 --> 00:23:19.630
(tourists speaking in foreign language)

340
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:20.463
Pope Tape one.

341
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.163
Trinkets, snow globes, ashtrays,

342
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:51.260
anything you wanted with the Pope's face on it,

343
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.963
just as I remembered it, not much different from Graceland.

344
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.800
A shopkeeper tells me, that's not exactly true.

345
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.590
They don't sell bobblehead Pope, or Pope soap on a rope,

346
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.390
bed sheets, that would be too crass.

347
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:11.833
Although every day there are people asking for them.

348
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.820
I'm curious to know of what you just bought in the store?

349
00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.900
<v ->Well, here we just bought more calendars and postcards.</v>

350
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.020
My brother calls the Pope his hero, he lives in Seattle

351
00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.940
and I have a whole lot of other stuff

352
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.410
but I happened to spot this

353
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.320
and I thought he'd enjoy that picture particularly.

354
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.943
So that's goin' to Seattle.

355
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:41.997
<v Annie>I told myself I wasn't buying it</v>

356
00:24:41.997 --> 00:24:43.547
for the same reasons they were.

357
00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:48.090
(vendor speaking in foreign language)

358
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.270
He's showing me his wares,

359
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.923
but I can't stop staring at his cigarette.

360
00:24:57.433 --> 00:24:58.300
He tells me he's Jewish

361
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.883
but that selling Pope souvenirs is an okay living.

362
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.833
And for me?

363
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.340
I'm also Jewish and I keep thinking this has something to do

364
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:15.113
with my fascination with the forbidden, the graven image.

365
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.100
There was a woman back in the 700s

366
00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.483
who literally consumed the images of saints.

367
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.700
She scraped some of the plaster from the frescoes,

368
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.583
mixed it with water, and drank it for its healing powers.

369
00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.740
I didn't go that far, but must confess,

370
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.103
there was one souvenir I still coveted.

371
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.070
Feeling shy about my Italian,

372
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.535
I asked my friend if she'd get me one.

373
00:25:53.535 --> 00:25:58.535 line:15% 
(Sabrina and vendor speaking in Italian)

374
00:26:00.616 --> 00:26:03.283 line:15% 
(playful music)

375
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.023
She got much more,

376
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.456
the actual story behind the now infamous lollipop.

377
00:26:16.456 --> 00:26:21.456 line:15% 
(Sabrina and vendor speaking in Italian)

378
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.930
You see the Vatican licensed the Pope lollipop,

379
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.203
but under one condition,

380
00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.933
there'd be no licking of the holy father's face!

381
00:26:42.487 --> 00:26:45.520
(Sabrina and vendor speaking in Italian)

382
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.479
<v ->So they say that, oh god.</v>
<v ->Oh god.</v>

383
00:26:49.479 --> 00:26:53.180
(Sabrina laughing)

384
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.173
<v ->It's like candy, only this is special probably.</v>

385
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.400
<v Annie>So wait,</v>

386
00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.690
if the Vatican licenses Pope lollipops,

387
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.440
then they must also license the rest of it,

388
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.173
and make money off of it, but how could that be?

389
00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:17.500
I needed an answer.

390
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.310
<v ->'Cause it's expensive to operate this place</v>

391
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.220
and you gotta get your money from some place.

392
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.510
There's an economic affairs branch at the Vatican

393
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.540
that deals with licensing the papal image

394
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.130
so that every time the Pope travels

395
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.510
there will be very complex negotiations

396
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.420
with local firms and agencies

397
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.070
about who can and cannot use the Pope's face,

398
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.180
who can use the logo of the Vatican.

399
00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.160
The balance they're trying to strike is on the one hand

400
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.110
they don't want the image sort of used in ways

401
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.260
that would seem unseemly, you know, unspiritual.

402
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.420
But on the other hand

403
00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.800
I think they want people to have access.

404
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.800
So that part never bothered me nor was it a surprise for me.

405
00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.410
Part of it is because, you know, my last assignment

406
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.527
before I came here was in L.A.

407
00:27:57.527 --> 00:28:00.680
and L.A. and Rome are both company towns

408
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.030
and they're about show business in some ways.

409
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.707
And so that experience

410
00:28:04.707 --> 00:28:06.973
translated pretty easily into being here.

411
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:11.270
<v Annie>John Allen,</v>

412
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.823
a reporter from Kansas now living in Vatican City.

413
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.423
Years from now,

414
00:28:16.423 --> 00:28:19.180
he'll serve as CNN's Vatican Expert at the Pope's funeral.

415
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.230
I forgot to ask what he thought about the Papas del Papa,

416
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.990
the Pope Potato chips with collectible images of the Pope

417
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:30.633
inside each greasy bag.

418
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.050
Just one of the sponsorship deals the Vatican made

419
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.853
to fund the Pope's visit to Mexico.

420
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:39.163
It was the same trip

421
00:28:39.163 --> 00:28:41.400
where the Pope spoke out against consumerism.

422
00:28:43.255 --> 00:28:47.088
(singing in foreign language)

423
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.903
Pope tape two.

424
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.730
They're all hoping that Pope John Paul II

425
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.983
will appear at his window, so they're singing beneath it.

426
00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:00.723
The world's largest serenade.

427
00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:05.872
(singing in foreign language)

428
00:29:21.239 --> 00:29:24.906
(fans cheering and singing)

429
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.500
But we can't get enough.

430
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.923
There's an insatiable appetite for this man and his image.

431
00:29:40.122 --> 00:29:44.230
(Pope in foreign language)

432
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.050
I watched as they devoured the Pope

433
00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.883
like they would potato chips.

434
00:29:49.108 --> 00:29:52.775
(fans cheering and singing)

435
00:29:56.791 --> 00:29:58.730
<v ->Many times when you see these images,</v>

436
00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.370
the pictures of groups of people or even individuals

437
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:05.250
going to the Holy Father, you see a much bigger smile

438
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.660
than people would normally have,

439
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.270
especially if you know the persons, you know,

440
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.680
you say, oh my gosh, they're radiating.

441
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.160
And I've seen my own pictures show the same thing.

442
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.420
<v ->Once when I met the Holy Father I said,</v>

443
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.320
Holy Father, I love you.

444
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.337
And he took his hands like this on my face

445
00:30:20.337 --> 00:30:22.193
and he said, I love you too.

446
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.600
<v Annie>I asked her if all this media attention</v>

447
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.110
ever got in the way of the Pope's message.

448
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:30.100
<v ->That could be that it's the media</v>

449
00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.120
that makes the popular thing to do.

450
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.310
But remember that we are also dealing with a Pope

451
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:39.310
who is an actor, who, you know, if the medium is the message

452
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.740
he understands the importance of getting a message forth.

453
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.730
And I think the basic reason why he would accept

454
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.690
the kind of attention that he gets from the people

455
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:54.520
is because it gives him a place, a medium,

456
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.750
an audience, a way, to again speak the word of God,

457
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.350
because what else does he speak?

458
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.027
(calm music)

459
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.360
<v Annie>The image is one thing,</v>

460
00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.870
the human being is another.

461
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.163
I forgot that Pope John Paul II was once an actor.

462
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:23.160
And I never knew that the Vatican has its own media,

463
00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:26.930
it's own radio, TV, newspaper,

464
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:29.283
or that nuns also read media theory.

465
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.540
The Media Liaison for the Vatican tells me,

466
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.350
she's not surprised that he's known as the media Pope.

467
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.640
And she ventures to imagine that the next Pope

468
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.290
will be a difficult role to fill.

469
00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.560
She couldn't grant me an interview with the Pope,

470
00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.333
but she could get me a spot on the press platform,

471
00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:53.543
and she did, Pope tape three.

472
00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.680
Holy Saturday, the eve of Easter,

473
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.580
one of the holiest nights of the year.

474
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:08.470
I feel flushed, that prickly heat on the back of my neck

475
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.753
as I walk past the Swiss guards to enter the Basilica.

476
00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:16.953
Would they discover my film was also about Elvis?

477
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.523
Is that a sacrilege?

478
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.920
<v ->Let us participate with an intense communion</v>

479
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.910
of faith and love in order to encounter the Lord,

480
00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.673
who on this night passes from death to life.

481
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:39.620
Let us welcome the Holy Father,

482
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.810
who in the atrium of the Basilica

483
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.350
is preparing to bless the new fire, light,

484
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.713
and the paschal candle.

485
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.280
The Basilica will remain enveloped in darkness,

486
00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.340
only to be gradually enlightened

487
00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.050
by the flame of the paschal candle,

488
00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.860
a symbol of Christ, the light of the world.

489
00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.420
At this point in the ceremony you are asked

490
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.820
to please refrain from using cameras with flash,

491
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.970
so as not to disrupt Liturgy.

492
00:33:11.012 --> 00:33:13.929
(cameras clicking)

493
00:33:23.492 --> 00:33:26.325
(uplifting music)

494
00:33:32.793 --> 00:33:35.710
<v Annie>Is this really happening?</v>

495
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.603
They told them not to photograph in five languages.

496
00:34:25.028 --> 00:34:26.328
Could they not have heard?

497
00:34:29.713 --> 00:34:34.046
(Pope speaking in foreign language)

498
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.843
How far would we go for a photograph?

499
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:03.000
I could think only of those final images of Princess Diana,

500
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.193
chased to death just 3 years before.

501
00:35:06.987 --> 00:35:08.687
That dreadful night in the tunnel.

502
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.783
Even in death, the cameras were still flashing.

503
00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.530
Killed for an image

504
00:35:21.895 --> 00:35:24.728
(fans chattering)

505
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:36.953
Super 8 reel four.

506
00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:43.920
We were each surprised to see others there,

507
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.580
at the gates of Kensington Palace.

508
00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.563
August 31st 2002, the fifth anniversary.

509
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.640
<v ->When we came here five years ago</v>

510
00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.540
it was an extraordinary, beautiful few days,

511
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:01.530
not in a wet way or pathetic way or hysterical day.

512
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.410
Some people were calling people

513
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:07.590
who were upset about the death of the Princess hysterical

514
00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.030
and the mob and the rabble.

515
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.160
And people weren't like that at all,

516
00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.350
it was actually a really genuine feeling.

517
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:16.031
And they weren't using the death of the Princess

518
00:36:16.031 --> 00:36:18.734
to make ourselves feel better,

519
00:36:18.734 --> 00:36:21.030
which I think is a very cynical way of viewing us.

520
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.640
It's just a genuine human feeling.

521
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.229
<v ->I don't think there's any boundaries on love,</v>

522
00:36:26.229 --> 00:36:30.000
I mean, it's just like, I'm a housewife in Florida.

523
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.680
You know, what am I doin' in England? (chuckles)

524
00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.165
But here I am.

525
00:36:34.165 --> 00:36:37.810
<v Annie>Maria's not just a housewife from Florida,</v>

526
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.440
she's a modest, but gifted poet.

527
00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.590
But this reporter will never find that out.

528
00:36:44.351 --> 00:36:45.500
<v ->What I call my Diana friends,</v>

529
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.770
you know, we all just kinda wanted to get together

530
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.910
and with the world situation,

531
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.470
I didn't know if I'd ever get over here again

532
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:53.910
so then I wanted to take this opportunity

533
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:56.610
to pay my respects to her and leave my poetry for her.

534
00:36:58.161 --> 00:36:59.130
So that's what I'm doing.

535
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.250
<v ->Are you gonna read your poetry aloud today?</v>

536
00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:04.200
<v ->Oh, no, no, but I've got it over there in a book.</v>

537
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.470
<v ->Now do you read it at the gates?</v>

538
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:09.883
<v ->I might, you never can tell, but it's on my website.</v>

539
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:13.083
<v ->I can say your planning to read the poetry at the gates?</v>

540
00:37:13.083 --> 00:37:14.980
<v ->I don't know, I hadn't decided.</v>

541
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.530
I've just got the poetry over there,

542
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.300
I'm gonna take the book and leave it

543
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.293
because I don't want it to get thrown away.

544
00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.590
But it's over there.

545
00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.880
<v ->What's your name?</v>

546
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:25.853
<v ->Maria Lindberg.</v>

547
00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.350
<v ->Maria, L-I-N-D?</v>
<v ->L-I-N-D-B-E-R-G.</v>

548
00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.120
<v ->Can I be rude and ask your age?</v>

549
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.103
<v ->48, it's not rude.</v>

550
00:37:35.076 --> 00:37:37.156
<v ->And you're from Pensacola, Florida.</v>

551
00:37:37.156 --> 00:37:38.356
It's your fifth anniversary,

552
00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.590
you've been coming here for five years.

553
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.935
I want to read my poetry for her.

554
00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:43.867
<v ->I'm gonna leave my poetry.</v>
<v Annie>Leave her poetry.</v>

555
00:37:43.867 --> 00:37:45.524
<v ->You're going to leave your poetry.</v>

556
00:37:45.524 --> 00:37:46.357
<v ->Yes.</v>

557
00:37:48.256 --> 00:37:49.690
<v ->Is there a little extract of the poetry</v>

558
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.590
we could put in the paper?

559
00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.082
<v ->Yeah, it's all over there,</v>

560
00:37:53.082 --> 00:37:54.490
you can pick out anything you want.

561
00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.490
<v ->It's on the gate, can you show us?</v>

562
00:38:01.347 --> 00:38:03.580
<v Annie>All these messages,</v>

563
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:06.030
like those written on the wall outside Graceland.

564
00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.350
Or prayers left at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

565
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:23.430
This is Terry Hutt, he's the one who started this ritual

566
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:26.220
of tying the flowers and messages to the gates,

567
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.420
and now others have already latched onto it.

568
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.820
Terry taught me not to be so quick to judge.

569
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.740
Underneath that silly hat, is a retired carpenter

570
00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.540
who volunteers with the elderly, disabled, and homeless.

571
00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:45.130
He met Princess Diana a couple of times

572
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.580
through their volunteer work.

573
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.420
<v ->I'm here to help people.</v>

574
00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.820
They come with flowers

575
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:57.820
and they don't come with tape or string to tie 'em up.

576
00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.180
And the reason that I help 'em is to tie 'em to the railings

577
00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.030
so that people don't lay them on top of each other.

578
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.710
And I always say to them, put 'em where you want

579
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.400
and I'll tie 'em up for you.

580
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:15.390
And it actually makes a nice display,

581
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.090
the flowers last longer with the wall holding them

582
00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.760
and they don't get knocked over and we don't lose messages.

583
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.123
And I think lots of people really appreciate that.

584
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:36.680
<v Annie>It still felt like the beginning of something,</v>

585
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:40.093
like witnessing these rituals forming just before my eyes.

586
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.900
The thing about ritual is it's always the same,

587
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.263
one year to the next.

588
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.670
I can jump from one anniversary to the next

589
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:53.243
without any notice, like now.

590
00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:57.633
Diana tape 12, the 10th anniversary.

591
00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:02.500
Five years have passed since the previous shot.

592
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.603
Terry is five years older, we all are.

593
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.010
It feels as though they're returning her image,

594
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:19.573
giving it back, an offering, maybe to alleviate the guilt.

595
00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.489
<v ->Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please remember</v>

596
00:40:31.489 --> 00:40:33.830
that this is a service for the people,

597
00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:38.560
this is not just a service on media, so please be civil.

598
00:40:41.283 --> 00:40:44.697
So, now just one minute to,

599
00:40:44.697 --> 00:40:49.250
can we try to be reasonably composed and quiet for a moment

600
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:52.543
to collect our thoughts and our minds.

601
00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.830
Amen, the Father and Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

602
00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:06.060
<v Annie>And that's where I met Margaret,</v>

603
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.810
the woman with the red jacket and the big Diana button.

604
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:13.510
She says she's known for the jacket and her collection

605
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.930
and that people call her the Loyalist Royalist.

606
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.830
Like a groupie, Margaret would show up

607
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.530
for all of Diana's public engagements to catch a glimpse,

608
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.600
shake her hand, give her flowers.

609
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.183
<v ->Welcome to Heritage House.</v>

610
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.410
<v Annie>Diana herself took one good look at her,</v>

611
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.293
smiled and said, Oh, you have got it bad!

612
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.520
<v ->(Margaret talking in background)</v>

613
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:38.344
<v Annie>Margaret laughs when she tells me this.</v>

614
00:41:38.344 --> 00:41:42.594
(guests laughing and chattering)

615
00:41:45.494 --> 00:41:48.060
<v Barbara>Oh, you've got the same poster, Margaret!</v>

616
00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.110
<v Margaret>Yes, where did you get yours from?</v>

617
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:51.450
<v ->eBay.</v>
<v ->Oh, right.</v>

618
00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:53.770
<v Annie>She invited several of us over to see her house</v>

619
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:54.960
which she's converted into

620
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.910
a Princess Diana themed bed and breakfast,

621
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:59.370
something she said that just sort of happened

622
00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:00.770
when her children left home.

623
00:42:05.153 --> 00:42:06.720
<v ->They're going over.</v>

624
00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.560
<v ->I have this one.</v>
<v ->Oh, do you?</v>

625
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.867
Where'd you get it, eBay?
<v ->eBay.</v>

626
00:42:10.867 --> 00:42:12.723
<v Margaret>You see, I'm not on eBay so.</v>

627
00:42:16.754 --> 00:42:17.848
<v Annie>What do you think?</v>

628
00:42:17.848 --> 00:42:20.193
<v ->I thought I had a collection, but wow.</v>

629
00:42:23.025 --> 00:42:25.108
I mean, they're fabulous.

630
00:42:30.787 --> 00:42:34.200
Do you think she'd miss a few items? (laughs)

631
00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.273
Only kidding, only kidding.

632
00:42:41.339 --> 00:42:42.589
Nothing to see. (chuckles)

633
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:48.578
<v ->This is the other side and there's a lot of it.</v>

634
00:42:48.578 --> 00:42:51.040
See the coach spread across there.

635
00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.460
That's also for Jubilee there,

636
00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:55.133
except for the shelf where Princess Diana is.

637
00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.120
You see, I need a bigger house,

638
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.730
you can tell I need a bigger house, can't you?

639
00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:04.023
Or I need a museum.

640
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.870
But this has more or less taken over my life

641
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:11.280
in the sense I seem to be doing it 18 hours a day almost,

642
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.030
it's just when I sleep I'm not thinking about it.

643
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:17.220
So, you know, I suppose it has taken over my life

644
00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.510
but I enjoy it.

645
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.860
I mean, I get called obsessed and things like that

646
00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.600
but people are obsessed about football, aren't they?

647
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.720
Obsessed about cricket,

648
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.270
so I don't really care whether they say that on not,

649
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:28.103
I just carry on.

650
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.000
<v Annie>Unlike Margaret,</v>

651
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.900
I'll never get to meet Princess Diana.

652
00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.980
As with Elvis, only the footage that remains.

653
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:44.550
<v Reporter>For a girl of 19 it was a difficult time,</v>

654
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:46.346
although perhaps a necessary demonstration

655
00:43:46.346 --> 00:43:48.220
of just how great are the pressures

656
00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.187
of living constantly in the public eye.

657
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.750
<v Annie>This is where the obsession begins.</v>

658
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.910
The moment that Diana the person

659
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.600
becomes connected with the image.

660
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.630
<v Paparazzi>We thought there would be an announcement</v>

661
00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:01.280
on his 32nd birthday but there wasn't

662
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:05.440
and he told reporters yesterday that it may be coming soon.

663
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.410
Have you any comment to make about that?

664
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.243
<v ->No.</v>

665
00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.480
<v Annie>Early news footage</v>

666
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.180
when there were rumors of a possible royal engagement.

667
00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.463
The birth of an image.

668
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.610
I spoke to a news photographer

669
00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.020
who covered Diana from these early days forward.

670
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.870
He tells me how it was love at first sight.

671
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.390
<v Reporter>I remember when Prince Charles</v>

672
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:31.290
announced his engagement, I sent a telegram

673
00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:32.650
and saying congratulations.

674
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:33.950
<v Annie>She was everything he dreamed</v>

675
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:37.163
the Prince would marry, young, fresh looking.

676
00:44:38.453 --> 00:44:40.810
He even told the prince himself this.

677
00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.170
He tells me,- you never took a bad picture of her,

678
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:45.240
and if you put her on the front page,

679
00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.970
you sell out of newspapers.

680
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:49.391
<v Reporter>And I suppose in love.</v>

681
00:44:49.391 --> 00:44:50.391
<v ->Of course!</v>

682
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:53.710
<v ->Whatever in love means.</v>

683
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:56.627
(triumphant music)

684
00:45:04.808 --> 00:45:08.600
<v Reporter>Miles and miles of billowing, English silk.</v>

685
00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.830
She didn't think she was actually going to be able

686
00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.609
to get on the carriage.

687
00:45:12.609 --> 00:45:16.571
(fans cheering and applauding)

688
00:45:16.571 --> 00:45:18.420
<v Reporter>Today the Prince and Princess of Wales</v>

689
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.040
looked relaxed after their shipboard honeymoon.

690
00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.870
How are you enjoying married life?

691
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.470
<v ->Highly recommend it.</v>

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:25.910
<v Reporter>After their honeymoon</v>

693
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.550
how did they find Scottish weather?

694
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:30.143
<v Annie>She did look happy here, holding hands.</v>

695
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.360
Before I realized it was directed.

696
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.440
<v Reporter>The Princess limits the constant requests</v>

697
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.890
to hold hands.
<v ->Hold hands!</v>

698
00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.220
<v Reporter>Today the Prince and Princess of Wales</v>

699
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.126
looked relaxed after their shipboard honeymoon.

700
00:45:43.126 --> 00:45:46.663
How are you enjoying married life?

701
00:45:46.663 --> 00:45:49.480
<v Reporter>I'm sure Diana will be a wonderful wife</v>

702
00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.060
to Prince Charles and a wonderful mother to his children.

703
00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:55.025
<v Reporter>And I suppose in love.</v>

704
00:45:55.025 --> 00:45:56.825
<v Diana>Of course!</v>

705
00:45:56.825 --> 00:45:59.742
<v Charles>Whatever in love means.</v>

706
00:46:00.785 --> 00:46:04.280
(fans cheering and applauding)

707
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.963
<v Reporter>There was a considerable bond</v>

708
00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:07.930
between them though.

709
00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:10.540
<v Annie>Today these same images tell her story.</v>

710
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.363
The same moments over and over again.

711
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:15.910
Always with commentaries by others

712
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:18.060
telling us what she's thinking and feeling.

713
00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:21.290
As though her image gave them direct access

714
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:23.603
to her innermost thoughts and motivations.

715
00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:32.193
What if for once we could read these images in silence?

716
00:46:33.070 --> 00:46:34.863
What truths might they reveal?

717
00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.373
I was surprised to find myself doing the same.

718
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.420
I believed that I could see her apprehension,

719
00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:50.803
releasing baby William into the wild, and to the cameras.

720
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.253
A protective look.

721
00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.893
A moment of pride as she plays her part.

722
00:47:03.327 --> 00:47:06.244
(cameras clicking)

723
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.993
An early distancing from Prince Charles.

724
00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:27.323
What's the expression, seeing is believing?

725
00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.610
It's this belief that fuels the need for the next image,

726
00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:35.720
which reveals the next truth, and the next,

727
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.793
and the next, and the next.

728
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:43.486
And that's when things get out of control.

729
00:47:43.486 --> 00:47:46.069
(upbeat music)

730
00:47:49.364 --> 00:47:53.465
<v ->I got something, I don't know if I'll end up using.</v>

731
00:47:53.465 --> 00:47:57.382
(fans cheering and applauding)

732
00:48:11.985 --> 00:48:16.568
(moves into "Also Sprach Zarathustra")

733
00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.380
But there were these moments too

734
00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:27.233
Rare glimpses of Elvis the person.

735
00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.930
They say there's an Elvis for everyone

736
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.963
and tell stories of his generosity, his accessibility.

737
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:39.670
How he'd stand outside Graceland

738
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.733
for hours signing autographs, posing for photographs.

739
00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.700
How he visited kids in the hospital,

740
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.433
wrote big checks for charities, paid off people's debts.

741
00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:57.393
How he gave away wheelchairs, cars, houses.

742
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.623
An Elvis for everyone.

743
00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:05.023
I even found mine.

744
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.580
Here he's just having fun, opening fan mail,

745
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:12.100
and pretending this is what they say.

746
00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.580
<v ->Dear Elvis, after 15 years we have finally learned</v>

747
00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:19.580
to understand what you say on record, signed RCA. (laughs)

748
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:23.713
My god, my god, why hast thou forsaken me? (laughs)

749
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:26.797
Signed, the Pope.

750
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:32.030
He even looks right at me,

751
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.280
making sure I caught the line about the Pope.

752
00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.840
How I wish I could have shown him this.

753
00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:42.430
It was one of those things

754
00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:44.393
that was just too good to be true.

755
00:50:46.956 --> 00:50:48.697
(bat cracks)
<v ->Whoa, did okay!</v>

756
00:50:53.908 --> 00:50:58.908
Because it was too good to be true.

757
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:08.300
Years later, I discovered this headshot

758
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.120
of actor Eugene Greytak.

759
00:51:12.697 --> 00:51:17.380
It's not the pope after all, but a papal impersonator.

760
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.830
I didn't believe it at first,

761
00:51:20.228 --> 00:51:21.928
but there was no denying the ears.

762
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:25.773
I swear I could hear the pope say,

763
00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:32.020
Seeing is one way of knowing, listening is another.

764
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:35.233
Go and listen.

765
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:41.850
Pope tape 20, Ansonia, Connecticut.

766
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:46.850
<v ->This is another oil of the Pope that's originally signed.</v>

767
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.320
<v Annie>Pete, also known as Polka Pete,</v>

768
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.393
is preparing to donate his entire collection to a museum.

769
00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.260
He told me he recently lost his wife,

770
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.163
but I didn't ask whether his collection started after.

771
00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:06.580
<v ->Public record newspaper,</v>

772
00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.260
so it's going to the Philadelphia Museum.

773
00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.030
What better than having an original sketch

774
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:12.100
from a Philadelphia newspaper.

775
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.900
<v ->And where'd you find that?</v>
<v ->eBay.</v>

776
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:21.940
But anyhow, that's the famous picture for here in Ansonia,

777
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:24.773
me shaking the Pope's hand.

778
00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.510
And I just thought this would be a memento,

779
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:28.660
I actually bought two of 'em,

780
00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:31.090
one to keep at home and one to go in the museum.

781
00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.300
So I've got a little smarter, little less expensive stuff,

782
00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.793
maybe I'll buy two and keep some stuff.

783
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.740
This is a wood carving.

784
00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:40.223
Again, I don't know.

785
00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.340
<v Annie>It isn't enough to collect.</v>

786
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.470
There's this impulse to share it with others.

787
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:48.920
A mission to keep this going.

788
00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:54.623
Like it's own museum of sorts.

789
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:59.353
<v ->My favorite item that I found one time probably,</v>

790
00:53:00.565 --> 00:53:02.380
it's a beautiful little pin

791
00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.120
and I think this one of the cutest things,

792
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.350
the Pope is a Polish boy.

793
00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:08.593
But that's what he was, he was Polish boy.

794
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:10.903
<v Annie>Pete's collection</v>

795
00:53:10.903 --> 00:53:13.350
seems so intrinsic to who he is.

796
00:53:13.350 --> 00:53:16.820
Like calling himself Polka Pete and being Polish,

797
00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.393
that I wonder if he'll actually be able to part with it.

798
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:26.800
<v ->Hi, there you are.</v>

799
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.610
Welcome, come on in and I'll show you my

800
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.480
30 year Elvis collection,

801
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.753
which we've kinda run outta room here so, don't be shocked!

802
00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.573
<v ->Elvis tape 50.</v>
<v ->Tad bit crowded.</v>

803
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:45.160
<v Annie>Rockin Robin's home, San Jose, California.</v>

804
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.743
<v ->Nobody's seen in ages, including myself.</v>

805
00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:51.973
This is what I used to do in the early days.

806
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.600
I used to go to all the Elvis concerts

807
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:58.350
and I would sneak in my tape recorder.

808
00:53:58.350 --> 00:53:59.930
And I would tape all the shows I went

809
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.060
so I had tape of Elvis talking to me.

810
00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:05.380
People go, you stuck that in your purse and taped that?

811
00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.350
<v Annie>Rockin Robin is known</v>

812
00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:09.530
for having the world's largest Elvis collection,

813
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:11.910
over 40,000 items.

814
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:14.460
Things Elvis actually wore or touched,

815
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.663
scarves, jackets, even his dental records.

816
00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:24.540
<v ->And these shows run from Las Vegas, 1972</v>

817
00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:28.950
all the way through December of 76,

818
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.890
the last three shows Elvis did in Las Vegas.

819
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:36.703
So I would sneak my tape recorder in and tape all the shows.

820
00:54:39.087 --> 00:54:40.990
It brings back great memories

821
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:43.230
and on one of these tapes you can hear him say,

822
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:45.320
Rockin' Robin, that's how I got my nickname.

823
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.320
February 3rd, 1974, Las Vegas midnight show, got a scarf,

824
00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.303
and a kiss, and my new nickname.

825
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.700
All right, I think if you listen really close.

826
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.757
He's in the middle of the stage

827
00:55:05.757 --> 00:55:07.720
and they start the intro to "Polk Salad Annie"

828
00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.323
and he comes over to me and he goes, Rockin' Robin.

829
00:55:19.259 --> 00:55:23.759
("Polk Salad Annie" by Elvis Presley)

830
00:55:34.115 --> 00:55:36.115
<v Elvis>Rockin' Robin.</v>

831
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.200
<v ->I still get chills when I hear that,</v>

832
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.800
I still get chills when I know

833
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.267
that he walked over and went, Rockin' Robin.

834
00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.060
<v ->Just grab hold, honey, anywhere.</v>

835
00:55:47.949 --> 00:55:49.528
There you go.

836
00:55:49.528 --> 00:55:51.695
Hi, you wanna get serious or just wait a little bit?

837
00:55:51.695 --> 00:55:52.620
<v Fan>Yes!</v>

838
00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.554
(audience laughs)

839
00:55:55.554 --> 00:55:57.721
<v ->Whoa, whatsamatter baby?</v>

840
00:55:59.234 --> 00:56:01.068
(fan sobbing and laughing)

841
00:56:01.068 --> 00:56:02.560
(audience laughs)

842
00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.160
<v Annie>To be kissed by Elvis.</v>

843
00:56:06.346 --> 00:56:07.929
<v Fan>I love you!</v>

844
00:56:09.651 --> 00:56:12.484
<v Annie>Would it feel like this?</v>

845
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:22.820
While scrubbing through my archive,

846
00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:25.173
I happened upon a few unnumbered tapes.

847
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:29.208
Rare moments when I wasn't thinking about the film.

848
00:56:29.208 --> 00:56:31.791
(somber music)

849
00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.640
My brother's wedding.

850
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.053
Matt, my love, who'd come on every shoot, now shooting me.

851
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:45.803
and Nora, she came all the way from Iceland.

852
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:50.223
The dance of time.

853
00:56:51.811 --> 00:56:53.811
A miraculous loop I can play infinitely.

854
00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.190
I'm losing count of how many memorials

855
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:10.043
and Easters there have been.

856
00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.163
Miscellaneous tape 34,

857
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:18.430
where I can no longer ignore my own obsession.

858
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.103
I'm 33 now.

859
00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:24.950
My fiancee Matt

860
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:28.560
who was there from the very start of this film, leaves.

861
00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:31.808
And my mom thinks I should get professional help.

862
00:57:31.808 --> 00:57:34.650
(soft music)

863
00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.550
I end up on this couch

864
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:39.000
talking more about the film than my relationship.

865
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:47.423
My analyst tells me a story of a patient, a hoarder.

866
00:57:48.629 --> 00:57:50.290
He tells me that when you're no longer able

867
00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:53.773
to tell what's relevant, everything becomes significant.

868
00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.340
I asked if he thought I was losing my way,

869
00:58:02.340 --> 00:58:04.990
but he's not in the business of answering questions,

870
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:06.173
only posing more.

871
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.250
I did what I do to make sense of my world.

872
00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:13.413
I continued shooting,

873
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:17.223
joining 800,000 on their pilgrimage to see the Pope.

874
00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:22.793
Pope tape 43, World Youth Day, Toronto.

875
00:58:24.497 --> 00:58:28.414
(fans cheering and chattering)

876
00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.810
Why did i think this was a good idea?

877
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.380
I tried to imagine the one image

878
00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:41.423
that might make this all worth it, and I couldn't.

879
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:46.963
Still, I kept shooting, bearing my cross.

880
00:58:48.445 --> 00:58:51.580
(rock music)

881
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.800
The Pope created this event

882
00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.600
to unite the youth around the world.

883
00:58:55.989 --> 00:58:58.860
500,000 now fill this airfield,

884
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:00.810
for what we sense will be his last one.

885
00:59:03.007 --> 00:59:06.757
(fans clapping and cheering)

886
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:16.063
A newspaper called it 'Popestock', the Catholic Woodstock.

887
00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.120
And I could see why.

888
00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.480
Pope tape 44.

889
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.400
<v ->I think the Pope is coming again to do mass in the morning</v>

890
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.060
and hopefully we'll get to see him.

891
00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.290
I think to night we're definitely not gonna sleep,

892
00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:34.440
we're gonna be up all night praying

893
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.186
and singing with other groups, getting to know other groups,

894
00:59:38.186 --> 00:59:39.180
we'll definitely not sleep.

895
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:42.019
It will just be a big celebration.

896
00:59:42.019 --> 00:59:44.643
(uplifting music)

897
00:59:44.643 --> 00:59:45.963
<v Annie>Pope tape 45.</v>

898
00:59:47.341 --> 00:59:51.258
(audience cheers and applauds)

899
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:03.993
Pope tape 46.

900
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.200
Last night, while I found shelter in the media center,

901
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.390
this youth group from Boston

902
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.273
camped outside in the rain and mud.

903
01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.550
<v ->Right now we're waiting for the pope</v>

904
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.610
and we're not sure if he's coming by.

905
01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:19.600
A lot of us are really frustrated and tired

906
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.880
'cause we didn't get a lot of sleep

907
01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.700
and we're just kinda waiting to see if he'll show or.

908
01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.940
And these are all these people behind us blocked our view.

909
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.390
And so everyone's kinda really annoyed right now.

910
01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:34.179
<v ->It's still really fun going.</v>
<v ->Yeah.</v>

911
01:00:34.179 --> 01:00:37.810
<v ->Even though we're all soaking wet and tired and stuff,</v>

912
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:40.303
it's still gonna be awesome no matter what happens.

913
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.250
<v Annie>Pope tape 47.</v>

914
01:00:47.843 --> 01:00:50.760
(crowd chattering)

915
01:00:58.179 --> 01:01:02.096
(fans cheering and applauding)

916
01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.947 line:15% 
<v Pope>You are young, and the Pope is old.</v>

917
01:01:25.156 --> 01:01:28.073 line:15% 
But the Pope still fully identifies

918
01:01:31.638 --> 01:01:34.388 line:15% 
with your hopes and aspirations.

919
01:01:36.395 --> 01:01:40.312
(audience cheers and applauds)

920
01:01:45.915 --> 01:01:50.730 line:15% 
You are our hope, the young are our hope.

921
01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:55.703 line:15% 
We are the sum of the Father's love for us

922
01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.497 line:15% 
and our real capacity to become

923
01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.963 line:15% 
the image of his son, of Jesus.

924
01:02:11.193 --> 01:02:15.110
(audience cheers and applauds)

925
01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.530
<v Annie>We left, filthy and exhausted,</v>

926
01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:38.423
each bearing our own cross.

927
01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:43.033
but each in our own ways feeling it was worth it.

928
01:02:44.294 --> 01:02:47.127
(uplifting music)

929
01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.303
Super 8 reel five.

930
01:02:57.570 --> 01:02:59.950
This Elvis Week, I finally made the pilgrimage

931
01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:02.463
to Elvis's birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi.

932
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.563
The shotgun shack his father built, the humble beginnings.

933
01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.400
I met his old neighbor, Mrs. MacComb.

934
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.480
She told me Elvis didn't have a halo.

935
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.100
<v Mrs. MacComb>He was just Vernon and Gladys's kid.</v>

936
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:20.520
And he was not a big deal.

937
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.050
But we kept up, I knew all the relatives.

938
01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:24.940
<v Annie>The kid next door.</v>

939
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:27.683
Hard to imagine now, that he's cast in bronze.

940
01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.313
Elvis tape 33.

941
01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.520
It was Joe's first time to Tupelo also,

942
01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.263
though he comes every year to Graceland for Elvis Week.

943
01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:45.690
His first trip was with his own father,

944
01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.830
and now he brings his son, Kyle,

945
01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:50.680
who he hopes will carry on this family tradition one day.

946
01:03:55.590 --> 01:03:59.270
When I ask him why he is a fan, he squirms and says,

947
01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:00.620
because my dad is.

948
01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:03.273
and He likes Elvis so much, and so do I.

949
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.883
He can't explain it, but isn't that explanation enough?

950
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.080
<v ->Elvis was born here in this house,</v>

951
01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.320
and because of that quirk of fate,

952
01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.780
Tupelo may become, if it isn't already,

953
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.300
the Mecca for rock and roll fans.

954
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.750
Janes Jones was two grades behind Elvis in school.

955
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:31.040
She said they were all dirt poor,

956
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.910
maybe that's why when Elvis made it big, truckloads of toys

957
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:37.360
starting arriving in Tupelo every Christmas

958
01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:38.980
for the town's needy kids.

959
01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.380
<v ->Of course it was anonymously,</v>

960
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.750
but everybody knew who was sending it,

961
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:46.340
it came from Memphis so it had to be Elvis.

962
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.433
<v Reporter>What has his death meant to Tupelo?</v>

963
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.660
<v ->Ain't no way we can say what we feel.</v>

964
01:04:55.101 --> 01:04:55.934
Well, it's  . . .

965
01:04:57.633 --> 01:05:01.100
it's like your own family has died.

966
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.100
<v Reporter>What did your daughter say?</v>

967
01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.667
<v ->She said, mama, it's like God himself died.</v>

968
01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:11.997
("Also Sprach Zarathustra")

969
01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.750
<v Annie>Images of the King World Championship,</v>

970
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:32.293
The Holiday Inn, Memphis, Tennessee.

971
01:05:36.809 --> 01:05:39.392
(lively music)

972
01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.140
To be named the Ultimate Image of the King,

973
01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:48.423
one must bring the crowd closer to Elvis.

974
01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:50.703
Elvis tape 95.

975
01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.440
I shot five tapes worth of belt buckles, sideburns,

976
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.403
gyrating hips, karate moves, rings, and jumpsuits.

977
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:04.110
I just couldn't help myself.

978
01:06:06.015 --> 01:06:09.060
(lively music)

979
01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.490
And found it unbelievable that fans treasured

980
01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:14.000
the sweat doused scarves of impersonators,

981
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.658
just as they had Elvis's.

982
01:06:16.658 --> 01:06:19.291
Look at this.

983
01:06:23.157 --> 01:06:28.148
♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪

984
01:06:30.206 --> 01:06:31.466
<v Annie>I remember Elvis once saying</v>

985
01:06:31.466 --> 01:06:33.476
that fans just wanted pieces of him

986
01:06:33.476 --> 01:06:35.081
for souvenirs, that's all.

987
01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:40.417
(impersonator singing)

988
01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:42.387
Maybe that's all.

989
01:06:45.538 --> 01:06:48.788
(impersonator singing "Teddy Bear")

990
01:06:57.688 --> 01:06:59.330
<v ->Elvis!</v>

991
01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.580
(impersonator singing)

992
01:07:07.428 --> 01:07:11.345
(audience cheers and applauds)

993
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.370
<v Annie>It was backstage where I discovered</v>

994
01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:20.833
why this event is called Images of the King.

995
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.620
They can't even use Elvis's name,

996
01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.770
out of fear of being pursued by his estate.

997
01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.903
And that's the craziest thing of all, catch that?

998
01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:37.173
Some already have been sued, and for what?

999
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.780
I learned they don't make any money doing this.

1000
01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.760
They just want to show the world how great Elvis was,

1001
01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.617
pass him on to the next generation, like others I'd met.

1002
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:52.750
This guy tells me he never really got the whole Elvis thing

1003
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:56.280
until he saw an impersonator who made him wonder,

1004
01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.903
was Elvis really this good?

1005
01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:07.293
He looked into it and discovered, Elvis was even better.

1006
01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.080
He's been performing Elvis ever since.

1007
01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.470
And it reminded me of the first time

1008
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:17.993
I fell in love with Elvis.

1009
01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:24.653
In a book of Kata Billups's Elvis paintings.

1010
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:29.253
Her Elvis is infinite.

1011
01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:36.913
And one day, she invited me to her studio in South Carolina.

1012
01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:43.540
<v ->This one is called "Jesus Taught Elvis to Cook."</v>

1013
01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.740
<v Annie>Elvis tape 99.</v>

1014
01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:48.230
<v Kata>Which could've really happened.</v>

1015
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:50.863
It's kind of a modern day mythology.

1016
01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:58.170
This is called, "I Saw Elvis on the Bumper Car Rides

1017
01:08:58.170 --> 01:08:59.850
at the Count Fair."

1018
01:08:59.850 --> 01:09:00.900
<v Annie>Kata said that Graceland</v>

1019
01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.460
has a way of sanitizing his image,

1020
01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.610
to a point where everything looks the same.

1021
01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:09.877
<v ->"I Saw Elvis Working Shoe Land."</v>

1022
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:25.870
This one is called 'I Saw Elvis by the Roadside

1023
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.787
Selling Velvet Paintings."

1024
01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:32.473
Susan Sarandon owns the original painting of this.

1025
01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.650
<v Annie>Off camera, Kata revealed that she too</v>

1026
01:09:46.650 --> 01:09:49.440
had received a cease and desist letter,

1027
01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:51.470
and it scared her enough to stop showing her work

1028
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:52.773
for a couple years.

1029
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.000
But could it really be so wrong

1030
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.963
to interpret what Elvis means to you?

1031
01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:00.492
<v Reporter>Are you satisfied</v>

1032
01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:01.769
with the image you've established?

1033
01:10:01.769 --> 01:10:02.807
<v ->Well, the image is one thing</v>

1034
01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:05.033
and the human being is another.

1035
01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:06.859
<v Reporter>How close is the image to the man?</v>

1036
01:10:06.859 --> 01:10:10.063
<v Annie>So, there's something I'm not telling you.</v>

1037
01:10:10.900 --> 01:10:12.923
A subplot I've chosen to ignore.

1038
01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.053
I'm not licensed either.

1039
01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.753
I keep going but always with this lingering fear,

1040
01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.033
could Elvis's estate shut me down?

1041
01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.220
They say there can be only one documentary about Elvis,

1042
01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:39.220
their own, one musical, only one official Vegas show,

1043
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:42.363
only one Elvis.

1044
01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:46.180
Because they claim ownership of Elvis,

1045
01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:49.913
his name, his image, his likeness.

1046
01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:59.540
Name, image, and likeness, what does that even mean?

1047
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.820
Because all these decades since his death,

1048
01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:09.303
Elvis has become an image, an idea,

1049
01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:12.713
that sits in each of our brains.

1050
01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.573
Can't there be room for everyone's Elvis?

1051
01:11:19.858 --> 01:11:22.275
(calm music)

1052
01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:32.926
Elvis as America.

1053
01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:34.551
As patriot.

1054
01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:37.218
As companion.

1055
01:11:37.218 --> 01:11:42.218
Elvis as French, and Elvis as Cowboy.

1056
01:11:42.537 --> 01:11:44.370
As sweatered.

1057
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.452
As lover.

1058
01:11:46.452 --> 01:11:48.652
As a life ring, a savior

1059
01:11:49.652 --> 01:11:50.485
As saint.

1060
01:11:52.770 --> 01:11:53.623
As martyred.

1061
01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:01.935
Maybe our images of Elvis say more about us than him.

1062
01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:06.406
It's how we internalize Elvis.

1063
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:14.803
All three of my icons, Elvis, the Pope, and Diana,

1064
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.963
have become ideas,

1065
01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:23.719
part of the landscape.

1066
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:49.043
How can you own something so big, so undefinable?

1067
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.237
So much a part of who we are?

1068
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:58.167
(door thuds)

1069
01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.533
It's strange to think of Elvis as property.

1070
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:11.323
Something that can be bought, sold, controlled, removed.

1071
01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:20.559
(thunder booming)

1072
01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.803
I had a dream last night.

1073
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.103
A nightmare actually.

1074
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.220
I dreamt the Elvis police came in the dead of night

1075
01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:33.713
and seized all of the film.

1076
01:13:37.810 --> 01:13:40.973
They returned, later, dropping off the remains.

1077
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:45.963
Not a trace was left of Elvis.

1078
01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:50.890
Panicked, I went to bury the remains

1079
01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:52.433
in an undisclosed location.

1080
01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:57.047
(somber music)

1081
01:14:02.248 --> 01:14:04.510
But it wasn't enough for them.

1082
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:07.363
Bloodthirsty, they went after others too.

1083
01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.883
Seizing original paintings, drawings, t-shirts,

1084
01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.340
and delivered the loot to Dracula himself.

1085
01:14:16.464 --> 01:14:20.214
(moves to suspenseful music)

1086
01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.743
<v Therapist>That must be unsettling</v>

1087
01:14:28.743 --> 01:14:31.090
after all the time you've invested in it.

1088
01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:33.690
To think you might not be able to complete the film.

1089
01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:36.403
What do you think you're gonna do?

1090
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.760
(voice begins to echo)

1091
01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:48.733
<v Annie>Pope tape 73.</v>

1092
01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:52.980
It's Easter and I'm back at the Vatican

1093
01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:55.930
for no other reason than it's another Easter with the Pope.

1094
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:59.913
My family no longer expects me home for Passover.

1095
01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.710
I managed to get tickets to what they call

1096
01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:06.383
a private audience with the Pope.

1097
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.570
but It wasn't as private as I imagined it.

1098
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:17.250
I imagined we'd get to exchange a few words.

1099
01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:23.292
(fans cheering and applauding)

1100
01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.643
But instead, he just passed right by me.

1101
01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:37.430
Leaving barely a trace.

1102
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:47.670
The truth is, when I stopped looking,

1103
01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:49.670
things began revealing themselves to me.

1104
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:54.740
Like, later that night when I stumbled into this little bar,

1105
01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:59.073
and there was Elvis again in the form of a cover band.

1106
01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.940
I'm used to him following me everywhere now.

1107
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:05.973
Pope tape 56.

1108
01:16:07.845 --> 01:16:12.845
(♪ I'm all Shook Up ♪)
(audience cheers and applauds)

1109
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:25.070
Floriana started telling me

1110
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:27.730
about how she first discovered Elvis,

1111
01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:29.953
and we slipped outside to hear each other better.

1112
01:16:31.685 --> 01:16:36.352
(Floriana speaking in Italian)

1113
01:17:19.385 --> 01:17:24.218
Then later that night over a coffee, I almost missed this.

1114
01:17:26.356 --> 01:17:29.423
<v ->Everything comes from the loneliness and sorrows.</v>

1115
01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:35.260
I think that all human beings have a big hole in the soul

1116
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.970
and when you felt alone, you look for something

1117
01:17:40.332 --> 01:17:43.293
that could fill it.

1118
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.083
Probably is strange or is sad that Elvis could do that,

1119
01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:51.663
I don't know, but I felt alone and Elvis was there.

1120
01:17:53.552 --> 01:17:55.969
(soft music)

1121
01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:19.300
<v Annie>Photographer Ralph Burns</v>

1122
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.300
has been collecting images of Elvis even longer.

1123
01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.560
Over 40 years.

1124
01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:25.453
<v ->I'm sort of overwhelmed.</v>

1125
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:28.293
<v Annie>He's become a good friend.</v>

1126
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.070
I asked him if he ever solved the mystery

1127
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:33.760
and he just smiled and said,

1128
01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.560
why do you think I keep coming back?

1129
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:39.923
<v ->File cabinet drawers full of negatives.</v>

1130
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:43.700
And many of them I've not really spent any time with yet

1131
01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:48.240
so I'm actually both looking forward to

1132
01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.843
and dreading on another level.

1133
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:58.850
<v Annie>More than anyone,</v>

1134
01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:00.160
Ralph understands what it's like

1135
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:02.900
to stay with one subject for so long.

1136
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.253
Still shooting on film, developing the work by hand.

1137
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:13.360
To me, his images get closest

1138
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.360
to that unknown thing I've been seeking.

1139
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:18.500
And I asked him if he'd sit

1140
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.250
and try to put all this into words,

1141
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.050
all the things I've never been able to.

1142
01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:28.970
<v ->I go there looking for things which to me</v>

1143
01:19:28.970 --> 01:19:32.180
reveal something about all of us.

1144
01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:36.033
How we interrelate with the beyond.

1145
01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:41.300
And I keep going back thinking I'm going to find an answer

1146
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.670
or that there is some definitive image

1147
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.053
that's gonna sum this up.

1148
01:19:46.192 --> 01:19:50.180
There's never a photograph that's gonna capture this

1149
01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:53.940
because it's not about the obvious, it's about the subtle

1150
01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.693
and the mysterious and the mystical.

1151
01:19:57.790 --> 01:19:59.490
And maybe I go back for that, too.

1152
01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:05.610
And I've got a deep appreciation of these fans

1153
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:11.073
who come year after year because of a deep abiding,

1154
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:14.863
now lost love, for another human being.

1155
01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:18.473
<v Annie>A deep abiding, now lost love,</v>

1156
01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:20.930
for another human being.

1157
01:20:22.044 --> 01:20:24.627
♪ Wise men say ♪

1158
01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.570
<v Annie>They were human beings too,</v>

1159
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:31.840
and knew what it meant to love.

1160
01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:34.753
Just listen.

1161
01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:39.956
♪ But I can't help falling in love ♪

1162
01:20:45.227 --> 01:20:47.853
<v ->But it's hard now to see this as an image of love,</v>

1163
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:50.223
without seeing loss.

1164
01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:59.560
(uplifting music)

1165
01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:09.610
We watched as the Pope received a feeding tube,

1166
01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:10.710
could no longer speak.

1167
01:21:11.882 --> 01:21:14.840
(cello playing "Elgar")

1168
01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:18.303
As Elvis retreated from the day, into the night.

1169
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:26.083
As Diana desperately sought privacy.

1170
01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:30.013
Their suffering.

1171
01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.333
Our guilt.

1172
01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.130
We'll never know which images

1173
01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:47.283
flashed before their eyes in their final moments, if any.

1174
01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:50.863
I have only their last pictures.

1175
01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.500
(church bells ringing)

1176
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:11.073
I came as soon as I heard the news,

1177
01:22:12.670 --> 01:22:14.053
knowing I had to be here.

1178
01:22:17.789 --> 01:22:20.622
(uplifting music)

1179
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:35.593
And here I am, on the very spot I stood all those years ago.

1180
01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:51.393
Only this time, he was gone.

1181
01:23:00.789 --> 01:23:03.622
(uplifting music)

1182
01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.450
I'm packing to leave

1183
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:34.823
and watching the funeral again on the TV.

1184
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:37.860
And it's like it's not over.

1185
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:45.650
No matter how long I spent with the Faithful,

1186
01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:46.953
how much I listened,

1187
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.840
I never did quite actually understand them

1188
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.683
until I lost the person who was that important to me.

1189
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.663
My aunt Nora fell quite ill.

1190
01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:11.280
She suffered for so long.

1191
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:15.663
Doctors were of little help.

1192
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.743
I called but never visited.

1193
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.340
How hard would it have been to have gotten on a plane?

1194
01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.223
She ended her own suffering.

1195
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.803
Took her own life.

1196
01:24:41.424 --> 01:24:43.591
Now there's nothing to do.

1197
01:24:44.710 --> 01:24:46.880
Nothing but memorialize her in a film.

1198
01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.303
("Dance for Cello")

1199
01:25:04.658 --> 01:25:07.950
I learned that even death has no ending.

1200
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:10.083
That grief never goes away.

1201
01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.780
There will always be unanswered questions.

1202
01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:37.733
Elvis tape 125.

1203
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:43.423
Elvis was only 42.

1204
01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:49.120
Hard to believe now that I am, too.

1205
01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:55.823
My last Elvis Vigil.

1206
01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.300
I shot just one tape.

1207
01:26:03.177 --> 01:26:06.010
(uplifting music)

1208
01:26:38.998 --> 01:26:42.498
(moves into lively music)

1209
01:27:09.334 --> 01:27:13.334
(audience cheers and applauds)
