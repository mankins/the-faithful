00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.390
And then we can see it on the TV!

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.400
Hold still Annie. Will you hold still?

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.530
Have you ever had one of those epiphanic
moments?

4
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.110
This intuitive thing hits you and, you know,
you must pursue it till the end.

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.790
Mine was here at a hot dog stand on a
lollipop.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.620
Yes, a lollipop.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.040
This would become the first picture in my
collection in a film about images.

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.470
Hey, welcome to 1288 Dolen Drive,
Memphis, Tennessee.

9
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.550
I have a lot of Elvis fans that come here.

10
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:38.730
Some of the photographs

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.870
I have are quite rare.

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.300
That's the famous picture for here at
Ansonia, me shaking the pope's hand, and I

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.800
think this is one of the cutest things.

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.280
The pope is a Polish boy.

15
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.430
This is more or less taken over my life in
the sense I seem to be doing it 18 hours a

16
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.050
day almost. It's just when I sleep, I'm not
thinking about it.

17
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.080
Many times you see these images, you see a
much bigger smile than people would normally have.

18
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.140
It's like your own family has died.

19
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.180
It's like God himself has died.

20
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.810
Everything comes from the loneliness.

21
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.160
All human beings have a big hole in the soul,
and then you felt alone, you look for

22
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.950
something to fill it.

23
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.230
Are you satisfied with the image you've established?

24
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.840
Well, the image is one thing and 
a human being is another.
